How to Make DIY Backpacking Meals You'll Love
A Step-by-Step Guide to Fueling Your Adventure with Meals that Taste Great

After that hike straight up to Look Out Meadow, my feet were aching. My thighs were burning. And all I wanted to do was sit down and eat a really good meal. But all the guides had packed was cheap mac’n’cheese, Boulder bars, and some Gatorade. Talk about disappointment. 

Listen, you did it! You finally got the permits you’ve been waiting for and now you’re packing for your trip. You’ve got the gear, you’ve got your maps, but one thing that’s stonewalling your packing process is your backpacking meals. 

You usually stick to DIY backpacking meals, you’re tired of the same old backpacking meals you always bring. But when you take a look at the prepackaged options out there, they're expensive! And that's one good reason why you prefer DIY backpacking meals. 

They're expensive! And you prefer to keep your backpacking meals cheap, and your destinations expansive. 

But don't make the mistake my guides made. Don't pack nothing but cheap food that has limited -- if any -- nutritional value. 

Instead, follow this step-by-step guide to making your DIY backpacking meals that won't break the bank. I'll even share with you exactly how I make my favorite backpacking meal -- Chicken Caprese Pasta -- when I'm on the trail.

One pot backpacking meals are a must on the trail.

3 Steps to Easy DIY Backpacking Meals that You'll Love

There are different types of DIY meals that you can make. You can fully prepare your meals and then vacuum seal them, so all you need to do on the trail is warm it up in the package. If you have a dehydrator or freeze-drier, then you can make your own "just add water" meals. 

Or you can choose to prepare your meals on the trail. Either way these are the 3 keys to easily make DIY backpacking meals that fuel your adventure and still taste great.

Pre-mix ingredients
Pre-package meals together
Prepare your meals simply

Step 1: Pre-mix your ingredients and spices.

What takes the most time when you’re cooking a meal? 

The prep work. 

You’ve got to trim your meat, measure out spices or dry ingredients, chop your veggies, etc. 

Lugging around a bunch of different spices and veggies isn’t a good idea when you’re backpacking. But that doesn’t mean you have to settle for bland food.

Pre-mix your favorite spice combinations, dry goods, or baking mixes before your trip.

You can keep your spices mixes labeled in an old sprinkles container, or you can toss them right in with your pre-measured quinoa, rice or pasta. Now you have a meal that only requires water to rehydrate.

With all of the measurements done beforehand, the only thing you have to do in camp is boil water and add your protein. 

Step 2: Pre-package Backpacking Meals Together

Keep all the ingredients you need for one meal packaged together, so your pack stays organized and unpacking your next meal is easy.

Pre-package one meal together with as little material as possible to reduce weight. I’d also suggest labeling it with the day, mealtime, and what it is.

If it’s all going into one pot, you can just put it in the same bag. 

Step 3: Prepare your DIY Backpacking Meal on the Trail

You’ve made it to your first campsite, and you’re ready to prepare your meal. 

You’ve already done all the hard work. Now pull out the pre-marked meal and start boiling water. Follow your recipe’s instructions, and bon appetit!

Those are the keys to making easy backpacking meals, but how do you make sure those meals replenish your body and still taste good?

What Makes a Good Backpacking Meal?

Your body and mind deserve the comfort of a good meal. While you don’t expect 5-star dining while you’re backpacking, that’s no reason why you shouldn’t have a few expedient comforts.

After a hard hike, a good backpacking meal replenishes your body, rebuilds your muscles and renews your spirit. Why suffer through utter exhaustion and deprivation because you don’t want to carry the weight of sustenance?

I’ve been there, done that, and there’s nothing worse than getting to your gorgeous destination only to be too depleted to move from your camp. 

Good backpacking meals are about balancing what your body needs with what you want. 

You want meals that are quick and easy to make, but that are also delicious, comfort food after a long, hard day. 

You need food that replenishes your muscles, refuels your cells, and renews your spirit. 

Oh yeah, and they need to be lightweight without a lot of packaging that turns into trash that also doesn’t cost a small fortune. 

Is that so much to ask? 

Let’s Talk about Backpacking Nutrition

Make your own granola with your favorite oats, nut, and fruit.
Contrary to typical backpacking wisdom, the most important factor in the food you bring while backpacking is not weight or type or packaging or even perfect nutrition. 

The most important factor in choosing what food you should bring backpacking is whether or not you will actually eat it. 

I have ended backpacking trips with extra food -- not because I packed extra food -- but because I was done eating terrible food and just wanted to get back. That's not a good way to cope.

Yes, I know oatmeal, boxed mac-n-cheese, and chicken and rice are some of the easiest and lightest foods you can bring backpacking, but they’re also the reason that I hated meal times when I was in Scouting — yes, I’m that picky eater.

Proper nutrition while backpacking lets you enjoy the journey — not just endure it.

I used to look at my trips as purposeful deprivation to see how much I could endure. While it was certainly character building, it was also unnecessary. Sacrificing nutrition kept me from fully experiencing the places I got to see because I was always too tired to actually explore them. 

Aside from bringing food you like, you should also bring the food with the nutrition that your body needs to replenish your muscles and renew your cells¹. 

Ever experience leg cramps toward the end of your trails? 

Yeah, that’s your muscles not getting enough magnesium.

Can’t poop? 

That’s because you’ve been eating protein bars and chicken and rice for three days with little to no dietary fiber and not a lot of fat. 

When you choose not to replenish your body, you risk chances of serious injury when your muscles give out. 

You need food that’s lightweight, won’t spoil, and is nutrient dense. That’s actually why I don’t recommend bringing rice and traditional pasta.

Here are some nutrient-dense options that will take your backpacking meals from bare and bland to nutritious:

Freeze-Dried, Dehydrated, or Sun-Dried Foods: 

These foods are lightweight and delicious. Some dehydrated foods rehydrate really well, like sundried tomatoes — especially when you add balsamic vinegar and basil pesto. But we’ll get there in a minute.

Proteins: 

Complete proteins are valuable sources of protein and fiber along with other essential nutrients like magnesium, iron, Omega 3s and B vitamins. 

Quinoa, Flaxseed, and Chia seeds are good examples of complete proteins that are great additions to your backpacking recipes. 

And because they’re more nutrient-dense, a little goes a long way. 

There are also a number of meats and cheeses that don’t require refrigeration and add tons of flavor to your meals. 

Think pepperonis, bacon bits, parmesan — do you see where I’m going with this?

Fats: 

Please don’t forget the fat! Many nutrients are fat-soluble², which means your body can only absorb them if you eat those nutrients with fat. Fat is also essential to the brain's processes³. 

Nuts, flaxseed, and chia seeds are a great source of healthy fats that are lightweight. But don’t be afraid to pack some additional fat like whole coconut milk or olive oil. Yes, it’s heavier, but if you premeasure your meals like we talked about, then you’ll find you’re not bringing a lot of extra weight.

Electrolyte drink mixes: 

While water should be your main source of hydration on the trail, having an electrolyte drink on hand helps your body replenish faster. 

Now that you’ve got a general idea of backpacker-friendly foods, let’s get into how to come up with ideas for DIY backpacking meals you’ll love.

Do-It-Yourself Backpacking Meal Ideas that Fit You

Instead of giving you a one-size-fits-most list of backpacking meals ideas, let's tailor this to you specifically. That means you first need to think about why you're DIYing your backpacking meals. And then, I'll demonstrate how I personally find new ideas for backpacking meals. 

There are a lot of valid reasons out there. And each one has a different challenge.

You have allergies or food sensitivities: 

Unless you have allergies or food sensitivities, you won’t understand the frustration and anxiety caused when you’re reading the back of a label and it says, “may contain traces of milk and soy”. 

Really? I’m not trying to play roulette with my digestive tract – does it contain milk and soy or not? 

In the end, you put the package back on the shelf because it’s not worth the risk.  You don’t want to be on the trail having bouts of diarrhea because it turns out there were traces of dairy or soy.

Your challenge: Finding food that's allergen free, yet still appropriate for backpacking. 

You have diet restrictions due to a health condition:

Many diabetics prefer to prepare their own food because they know how their blood sugar reacts to certain foods and the amount of exercise they’re doing. By preparing their own food they control what they’re taking in and prevent unwanted health complications on the trail.

Your challenge: Making sure you pack balanced meals on the trail, while also having super, easy snacks to keep your sugar up throughout the day.

You like to keep your backpacking meals cheap:

DIYing your food is how you keep your backpacking meals cheap. In fact, that’s how I started out. I would scrape together the money to go on these week-long trips, and then have to keep my food as cheap as possible. Was it worth it? Absolutely, but it also had its consequences. 

While I enjoyed the challenge and the hikes, I was usually too tired after a day’s hike to do more than cook food and play cards in camp. So even if you’re going the cheap route, don’t skimp on nutrition.

Your challenge: Learning what foods are worth the extra cost, so you can properly fuel your adventure. 

Or maybe, you’re a picky eater with a highly refined palette:

You understand that texture matters, and sometimes “just add water” doesn’t cut it. I’m right there with you. I can only eat so much oatmeal out of the package before I start getting a gag reflex. And the watery mush that results from a lot of expensive premade backpacking meals is insulting. 

For us, switching up your cooking methods is going to give you the variance in selection and better textures to your food. We’ll talk more about that a little further on.

Your challenge: Adding variance of textures and types of food, so that you don't get tired of eating. 

What Cooking Equipment Do I Need?

Before I show you how I put together my meals, you need to have the right equipment. (No, there are no affiliates. These are just what I carry with me.)

I’ve backpacked with the bare minimum of an oversized camp mug, camp knife, and water bottle. It works, but it also taught me that some things are worth the weight.

Here’s what I use now:

Aluminum Mess Kit
Aluminum is lightweight and heats up quickly. Bring at least the top and bottom of the mess kit, so you can then steam bake goodies on the trail.

Silicone Baking Cups
These beautiful inventions make baking on the trail possible. They are light, durable, and easy to pack. 

Utensils 
I keep my utensils simple. A lightweight combination fork and spoon, and my trusty camp knife. 

Camp Stove and Fuel 
As much as I love cooking over a campfire, you may find yourself in a circumstance where you’re not allowed to build a fire. It may be because there’s a drought in the area, or it may be the policy of that particular park. 

So find a camp stove that fits your needs. I have a wood burning stove that has never let me down. But if you prefer a steady fuel source, then reach for a compact gas stove.

How to Come Up with Your Own Backpacking Meal Ideas

This is easier than you think. You probably already have the recipe; you just need to make backpacker-friendly substitutions.

First, make a list of all your favorite meals. Then, go through that list and scratch off all of the ones that are just not possible.

Once you’ve narrowed down the list, see what backpacker-friendly substitutions you can make to achieve the same tasty sensations of your favorites. 


Here’s one of my favorite meals as an example...

My Favorite Backpacking Meal: Camp Caprese Pasta 

A favorite meal of mine is Caprese – like anything caprese. The combination of tomato, basil, mozzarella and balsamic vinegar is simply irresistible to me.

My Caprese Pasta recipe normally uses:
Camp Caprese Pasta in my trusty camp mug.

Fresh tomatoes
Whole mozzarella
Fresh basil
Balsamic 
Olive oil 
Chicken
Spaghetti

Now fresh tomatoes are too squishy for backpacking, so I substitute them for sundried tomatoes. 

Spaghetti breaks too easily, so I exchange that with a short whole wheat or legume pasta like bowtie or shells. Legume pastas use lentils or chickpeas in the pasta dough giving the pasta more protein and fiber than your traditional pasta. It adds nutrition without extra weight.

Mozzarella is out because it’s a soft cheese that requires refrigeration after 24 hours, but parmesan is a hard cheese and can last longer — especially when you combine it into a pesto. 

That’s right. I premix the rest of the ingredients and the parmesan cheese into a pesto. If you like pine nuts, you can certainly add those too.

In camp I cook my pasta, drain most of the water but not all, add my sundried tomatoes and fully cooked chicken to heat through, and then toss the pasta with the pesto. 

Voila! Chicken Caprese Pasta on the trail. It’s an easy, nutritious, filling, delicious backpacking meal that is lightweight, inexpensive, and takes about 10-15 minutes to cook.  And this is also great with bacon bits. Yummm…

Now, I have a sweet tooth, so my meal doesn't end with the main course. And a hard day’s work deserves dessert!

The Best Backpacking Dessert I’ve Ever Had...

It’s no secret that I have a sweet tooth and a chocolate addiction. So I figured out how to make my favorite dessert while backpacking: Chocolate Coconut Cake

Never skip dessert
Remember those silicone cups? Yep, this is their main purpose in life. 

Using a steam bake method, I can bake cupcakes, muffins, dumplings, and biscuits on the trail.

I cut down the regular recipe to just 2 servings and pre-mix all of the dry ingredients beforehand. It comes out to about a cup of dry mix, and half a cup of liquids. 

And it’s worth every ounce! 

Normally this cake uses eggs, but they’re hard to subdivide and harder to pack, so I substitute milled flaxseed instead. 

I bring a carton of unopened coconut milk that doesn’t need to be refrigerated. I use most of it to make a creamy sauce at dinner and reserve a couple tablespoons for the cake.

At camp, after I make dinner, I put a little water in my mess kit to boil, then I set the batter-filled silicone cups into the boiling water. Make sure the water isn’t more than halfway up the cups or else you’ll get soggy cake instead of fluffy, moist, amazing cake. 

Finally, I put the lid on and let it bake for about 10-15 minutes, while I eat my dinner.

Now you may think that the cake will come out sticky instead of fluffy because of the steam, but trust me it doesn’t! — remember, I’m picky. 

Baking these cupcakes comes out better than when I make it at home because, I’ve never had my cakes burn using the steam bake method.

How to Get the Elusive Yosemite Backpacking Permits for the Trip of a Lifetime
Hint: Planning Ahead is Key when Applying for Backpacking Permits for Yosemite National Park

Thousands of people retreat to Yosemite National Park for outdoor adventures of all kinds every year. The pristine wilderness trails, the remarkable views, the tranquil lakes, they’re all prime reasons why we flock to Yosemite.

But that’s also why your Yosemite backpacking permit could be the most competitive application you ever send in. Everyone wants to see Yosemite. So when planning a backpacking trip to Yosemite, the more in-advance that you plan, the better. 

When Should I Start Planning on Backpacking in Yosemite National Park?


You need to start planning your backpacking trip to Yosemite about 4-5 months in advance. The weather you’re in right now should be different from the weather you’re planning to backpack in — that’s how far in advance it should be. With the seasonal lottery system, you can plan trips up to 6 months in advance. (More on that to come.)

In the off-season (October-December), you can get permits weeks, or even days, in advance, depending on the trail. But if the quota — that’s the amount of permits allowed per day — is reached before you put your name in, you’d have to apply for another day, which could be a bummer. 

But since there are weekly quotas during the off season, you can try again until you get it. (And we hope you get it!)

Now, some popular trails require separate permits, we’ll dive into those now.

So What Backpacking Permits Do I Need for Yosemite? 

The backpacking permit for Yosemite that you’ll be applying for is the Wilderness Permit. Anytime you venture into the backcountry to spend the night, you’re required to have a Yosemite Wilderness Permit. 

But there are also camping permits, campfire permits, and a couple specific trail permits that you may need as well depending on your route. We’ll cover those below. 

How Do I Get a Yosemite Backpacking Permit?

During Yosemite’s busiest season, late April through October, there is a lottery system with a daily quota in place. 60 percent of permits are released 24 weeks in advance of the trip date, between Saturday and Friday of the open application window. 

At the end of each week, the lottery period closes, and the remaining permits that have not been accepted become available on a first-come, first-serve basis. These can be used to plan trips three days in advance. 

Once the 60 percent of permits are released, the remaining 40 percent become available seven days in advance of the desired reservation date.

Okay, it sounds really complicated when it’s written out like that, so let’s give an example so you see how this plays out.

You apply for a Yosemite Wilderness Permit on December 15, 2024 for your backpacking trip starting on June 1, 2025. (That’s the earliest you can apply for it.) 
You wait a week until the applications close on December 21.
The lottery ensues
 You get the results notification on December 23
You must now accept the permit by December 26 or else they will release your reservation on Dec 27 to go through another lottery 3 days before June 1. 

(This timeline is directly from the NPS.gov, and should be the most accurate information)

So really, within two weeks of applying for your wilderness permit, you should know if you got it or not. 

But what do you do if you don’t get the permit?...

What if I Don’t Win the Permit Lottery?

You don't want to miss this view.


Your dream trip isn’t dead yet! 

If you lose out on the first lottery, then you can still wait for the leftover 40% of the permits. These become available on a first-come-first-served basis, and they sell out faster than Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour…okay maybe not that fast. 

But it’s still quick, so go to Recreation.gov to reserve a permit 7 days in advance of your trip, and be ready at 7:00 am PST when they open up reservations. 

If you still lose out, guess what? You can try for the 3-day lottery permits that those formerly lucky hikers decided not to accept. You’ll see the results the same day, so you can still get to the trailhead in time. 

Do you want to avoid the emotional rollercoaster of preparing for a trip, and then losing out on the last-minute permits and lotteries? 

Yeah, me too. So here’s your third option; try for a different permit entirely. 

There are many other parts of Yosemite that are just as beautiful. Don’t get too set on your itinerary before you have the permit in hand. Try to go for the less popular permits to increase your chances of getting it. 

Crisis and last-minute planning avoided.

What If My Wilderness Permit Application Gets Rejected?

Sometimes, your application gets straight up rejected. Whether it was user error on your end or filling error on their end. It still sucks. Especially if you don’t have any other time to backpack and you can’t just reapply for a later date in the lottery?

Don’t lose hope!

California has so much to offer. While Yosemite has a renowned reputation for its sights, many other national parks with lesser-known trails have more availability and make excellent backup options. (Have you looked at Sequoia or Kings Canyon National Park by chance?)

How Do I Get a Walk Up Backpacking Permit in Yosemite?

Walk-up wilderness permits exist but are rare during Yosemite’s busiest months. April thru October, do not expect to get a walk-up permit.

From late October to mid-April – the chilliest times of the year when accessibility is questionable – the availability increases, and walk up permits are available the day before or day of your hike. You can get them at wilderness centers throughout Yosemite during business hours, which are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

If you plan to hike on a popular trailhead that requires a permit, these permits are available at permit issuing stations at the start of each trailhead – again, only during the off season.

How Long Will It Take to Get My Permit?

During the lottery system of the busy season, no matter which day you apply during the weekly application windows, you’ll receive your results on the following Monday. 

If you’re trying for the first-come-first-serve permit 7 days in advance or a 3-day lottery permit, then you’ll apply in the morning and get your results that afternoon or evening. 

Trails the Require Additional Permits

For overnight camping you need a backpacking (aka wilderness) permit in Yosemite. Day hikes do not require permits unless you plan to hike in Half Dome or through the Donahue Pass of the John Muir Wilderness, which each have a separate permit from Yosemite that you must obtain.

Half Dome


Hiking to the top of Half Dome depends on the cables along the route up the massive rock being installed for safety and crowding purposes. Weather permitting, the cables stay up between Memorial Day (end of May) to the second Monday of October. 

Half Dome has a quota of 300 hikers per day, 225 of which are day hikers and the remaining 75 are for backpackers. And guess what? Half Dome permits don’t cost anything.

The permits for Half Dome are awarded by lottery, which takes place between March 1 and March 31. And you can expect the results in mid-April, (Fingers crossed)! 

Throughout the season, permits are available two days in advance of your planned date if you already have a wilderness permit. You’ll get notified the night of the day on which you applied. 

Donahue Pass to John Muir Wilderness


The John Muir Wilderness area has an exit quota! Say what?

An Exit Quota means they only let a certain number of people leave Yosemite and enter the John Muir Wilderness complex per day. 

Backpackers who use Donahue Pass to leave Yosemite require a permit, as their exit quota limits departures to 45 per day, these permits do not cost any money.

What Is the Difference between a Yosemite Wilderness Permit and a Yosemite Backpacking Permit? Do I Need Both?

A Yosemite Wilderness Permit covers several different outdoor activities in Yosemite from backpacking to wall climbing. You need one anytime you're spending the night in the backcountry. 

The term is used interchangeably with Yosemite backpacking permits because backpacking is one of the main activities that requires this permit, but technically it covers more than just backpacking.

So, no, you don’t need both. They’re the same permit.

The exceptions are Half Dome and the southbound John Muir Trail through Donahue Pass that we already discussed. Even though these hikes can be done in a day, you still need a wilderness permit. 

Are There Any Other Permits I Need for Yosemite?

Reserving a campground requires a separate application with a different lottery system (through the busy months), and a first-come-first-serve system the rest of the year. And whether you plan to have a campfire or not you may need a campfire permit depending on the season.

Driving through Yosemite also needs a separate reservation during busy times of the year specified on the website of the National Park Service.

Conclusion

If you found this helpful for making your Yosemite backpacking permits a reality instead of a pipe dream, then you’ll love our Permit Strategy Guide. 

Truth is; it’s not just Yosemite that can be difficult to find the right permits for. A lot of the California parks and public lands have different procedures that you have to research before you can even apply. And it gets frustrating when you keep missing out on the permits you’re looking for because you didn't know how or where to apply.

That’s why we created the Pathloom Permit Strategy Guide. 

You see, we’ve had to go on the same permit scavenger hunts, and we’ve found it just as frustrating. Hence why we’re in the process of building an app that can do it all for you. 

But until that gets here, we want to share the strategies we’ve learned to avoid disappointment and to get you into the backcountry with the right permits. 

Become a Trailblazer. Answer some questions that will get used to create your all-in-one trip planning app for backpackers, and the Pathloom Permit Strategy Guide is all yours.

Is Your Backpacking Emergency Kit Up to Date?
7 Emergency Items to Pack in Your Backpacking Emergency Kit Right Now
A backpacking emergency survival kit is essential to a safe trip.

You feel the pain radiating from your head down to your spine. You slowly open your eyes and realize you’re looking up to the sky under a tree canopy. How did you get here? How long has it been? 

You roll over and a new pain makes itself known. Your ankle is swollen. You're lying among some rock and brush, and nothing looks familiar. 

You have nothing except the clothes you’re wearing. And the stuff in your pockets. What are your next steps? How do you get yourself to safety?

As backpackers, we know that one wrong step can take you from an enjoyable backpacking trip to an emergency situation. Are you ready for it? Is your backpacking emergency kit packed and up-to-date? 

Whether you’re injured or lost, time is critical. That’s why packing the right emergency gear is essential to staying safe and improving your situation when things take a turn for the worse.

Key Insights:

You should keep a backpacking emergency kit with you at all times when you're in the backcountry.
The key items to include in your kit help you survive and get help in a worst-case scenario.
These items help you stay hydrated, stay warm, build shelter, and get help. 
You should customize your kit to your personal backpacking needs.

What Is an Emergency Backpacking Kit?

Backpacking lets you venture deep into nature’s beauty, giving you a front-row seat to its peaceful, awe-inspiring landscapes. But let’s be real… While that solitude is magical, it can also bring unexpected challenges. That’s why we always carry an emergency backpacking kit when we’re in the backcountry.

So, what’s an emergency backpacking kit? It’s a lightweight, compact bag filled with the essentials you need if things don’t go according to plan. 

Unlike your main pack, which holds all of your camping gear, this kit is easy to grab as you wander around your campsite or explore nearby trails. It’s always by your side – just in case. 
And not just for your sake.

Hiking has exploded in popularity across the U.S., with nearly 59 million people hitting the trails in 2021 – a whopping 80.4% increase since 2010. That means more new hikers and, unfortunately, more injuries. But you know there’s no need to worry because you’re prepared with an emergency kit for when something does go wrong.

To help you stay safe and sound, we’ve handpicked 7 must-have items we never hit the trail without. As a special bonus, we’ve put together our Ultimate Backpacking Checklist – drawing on 1,000+ adventure experiences – to make sure you're always prepped for anything the backcountry throws your way. So let’s get to it!

1. A Signaling Device to Call for Help
In a wilderness survival situation communication is critical.
Ever wonder why some first aid kits come with a mirror? Sure, it’s great for making sure you look great, but it has another trick up its sleeve. It can reflect light to help you signal for help if you’re lost. A signal mirror grabs the attention of aerial search teams.

Another reliable way to get the attention of searchers in your vicinity is a whistle. Whistles on lanyards are easy to access during hiking and close by in case of an emergency. The downside is these two solutions only work within a short distance.

Short of burning SOS on a hillside, a Satellite communicator, Garmin inReach Mini or SPOT, is your best option for getting a message for help out. Most send a distress signal that searchers can pinpoint your location. While others periodically wake up, plot your position, and send and receive short messages.

These are a reliable resource for backpacking in remote regions that don’t have a reliable cell signal. They’re basically a high-tech “Help-I’ve-fallen-and-I-can’t-get-up” button for backcountry adventurers everywhere.

2. Cordage to Hold It Together

Paracord is the favorite cordage of wilderness survivalists

Cords are like the Swiss Army knife of backpacking – endlessly useful! From replacing a broken shoelace to securing gear, cordage saves the day. But not all ropes are the same.

For steep climbs, you’ll need a climbing rope that can handle the rugged terrain. Most backpacking trips, however, only need something lightweight, durable, and versatile. Paracord is a slim but strong cord that's a backpacker’s best friend. 

Whether you’re fixing gear or making an emergency shelter, paracord gets the job done without taking up much space.

3. Ultralight First Aid Kit

First aid kits can be bulky, but there are plenty of options designed for backpackers that are lightweight, portable, and even waterproof! These kits have essentials like bandages, gauze, and antiseptic wipes – all protected from the elements. 

Unlike standard first aid kits though, ultralight first aid kits only have single doses of medicine and limited duplicate supplies. So it's up to you to restocked after you use consumables. 

You should also tailor your kit to you and the kind of trip you're on. If you're allergic to Tylenol, then you want to replace that with a different type of acetaminophen. 

4. Emergency Blanket for Warmth and Shelter
Emergency blankets are good for warmth and shelter.
Originally designed for astronauts, the emergency blanket is now a backpacker’s go-to for staying warm when things get rough. This super-light, foil-like blanket reflects your body heat back to you, helping you fend off cold weather, rain, and even shock. 

They’re small enough to stash in any pack, but keep in mind that they wear out quickly. Only use them in real emergencies and replace any that show wear and tear.

5. Dry Fire Starter
Keep your dry tinder in watertight container in your pack.
Fire is your best friend in the wild. It keeps you warm, wards off animals, and can even signal for help. But starting a fire, especially when injured, isn’t always easy. That’s why a dry fire starter is a must. 

You can buy manufactured fire starters that ignite quickly or make your own. Cotton balls soaked in paraffin wax are a backpacker’s hack. They’re light, super flammable, and you can subdivide them to use for multiple fires. Just be sure to check the rules and follow fire safety tips in the area you’re hiking to avoid accidentally sparking a wildfire.

6. Fire Ignition Tools
Fire sticks take practice to use effectively
Bringing plenty of matches is always a must in a backpacker's kit, but what if they get wet?

Ferrocerium rods (also known as ferro rods or fire sticks) are a reliable tool for starting fires to bring to the wilderness. These handy tools produce super-hot sparks when struck, making them perfect for igniting tinder in any weather. They’re durable, reusable, and easily packable. 

But they do take some skill to use effectively, so make sure you practice starting a fire with a ferro rod before you need to rely on it. Also, be aware that you can't with a ferro rod, so plan to buy it once you get to your destination. 

Always carry a backup fire-starting tool to ensure you can stay warm and signal for help when needed.

7. Back Up Water Purification System
Iodine is a small yet effective disinfect used to purify water.
Unless you're backpacking through a dessert with no sources of water, you already have a water purifier on your list. Most wilderness water isn’t safe to drink, so it’s crucial to filter it. 

As water is life on the trail, this is the one place where redundancy is okay in backpacking. A water purification system, like iodine tablets or a trusty water filter like a LifeStraw, are lightweight and small. And they ensure that if your primary purification method fails, you can still have safe, clean drinking water from natural sources.

Conclusion: The Bonus Gear for Your Emergency Backpacking Kit that Weighs and Costs Nothing

Remember that scenario we started with? 

I didn't make that up. It's what actually happened to a wilderness guide, when he went to scout the trailhead of the next leg of his journey. 

After sustaining a concussion, thinking he was returning to his group, he got lost. He had nothing except what was in his pockets at the time of his accident. But he made it out alive and under his own power.

How? 

Over the years he prepared himself with knowledge of the area and outdoor skills like:

Orienteering 
Celestial Navigation
Edible plants
Trapping
 This knowledge costs nothing but time, weighs nothing, and is always with you. So take some time to learn about the area you'll be backpacking through. Learn about the terrain, landmarks, bodies of water, and edible plants in the area.

It might just save your life.

How to Stay Safe during California Wildfire Season while Backpacking
7 Fire Safety Tips to Use during Wildfire Season in California

Imagine you’re halfway through your backpacking trip through San Bernardino Pass and two days away from civilization. As you’re hiking, you start smelling smoke…

Just a little smoke at first. It’s probably a fellow backpacking setting up an early camp, right? 

Then, the smell gets stronger, and the clouds seem darker. Is it smog, or is it a wildfire? 

How do you safely avoid a wildfire while backpacking? And what fire safety should you be following to make sure you aren't the cause of the next wildfire?

California is unique. Backpackers can explore its peaceful redwood forests, arid desert valleys, and lush mountains. Nevertheless, backpacking during the California wildfire season can be daunting if you’re not prepared. 

Smoke from wildfires in California 2024
Key Insights

California wildfire season is a year-round affair.
Humans cause 85% of wildfires.
Prepare for your trip by learning alternate routes that can lead you out of wildfire territory and by filing proper permits.
If you're caught in a wildfire, seek fire resistant shelter, (like a group of boulders or a body of water) immediately.

When Is Wildfire Season in California?

Most wildfires are during the warmest parts of the year from April to October, but in California, they can occur year-round. California’s naturally hot, dry climate makes it easy for even the smallest campfire to spread if it’s not properly tended. 

Just this year, almost 830,000 acres in California burned. The Park Fire – the fourth biggest in California history – started when a man pushed a burning car into a gully. It spanned areas in northern California, including Lassen National Forest. 

As a result, backpacking is limited in areas of Lassen National Park, while other areas – including Highway 89 – won’t open until September.

Fire Safety Tips for Backpacking during Wildfire Season in California

Backpacking in California is a rewarding experience for all types of adventures. Just as you would plan for a health emergency, you need to plan for weather emergencies. Here are seven fire safety tips that’ll keep you safe during wildfire season in California.

1. Familiarize Yourself with California’s Fire Safety Resources 

Knowing about fire safety resources in emergency situations saves lives. CAL FIRE and InciWeb are two fire tracking websites that you can use to check for updated fire information. They also provide strategies for what to do if you’re caught in a wildfire. 

And if possible, call 911. Let firefighters know sooner where the wildfire is, which can mitigate its spread and protect yourself and other backpackers in the wilderness.

2. Get the Correct Backpacking Permits

Most national parks in California require backcountry permits, and the process for obtaining them varies with each one. When a forest fire starts, those permits tell park rangers how many people they have in an affected area, and how to get in touch with them. 

If they’re in an area without cell coverage, then the rangers look at the itinerary (or talk to your emergency contact) to find your probable location, so they can get you to safety. 

3. Practice Leave No Trace (LNT) Principles

Wildfires are more common in rural areas and regions with dry vegetation and higher temperatures. And from an old cigarette butt to neglected campfires – to say nothing of pushing an already burning car into a gully – humans cause 85% of wildfires in the US according to NPS.org. 

These fires are preventable. So practice Leave No Trace. 

Don’t have a fire when under a burn ban. 
Keep your fire small. 
Burn your fire to ashes.
Have enough water put out your fire. 
Scatter your ashes. 
And never leave a fire unattended. 

It’s that simple.

4. Seek Out Trails in Fire Resistant Ecosystems

The view along the John Muir Wilderness Trail is a good alternative route.
The coastal and high-altitude regions are good examples of fire-resistant ecosystems because the climate doesn’t lend itself to fire. The coast is more humid. And high altitudes don’t have the same quick burning vegetation. So they tend to have less wildfire activity

Big Sur, Point Reyes, and the Lost Coast Trail offer breathtaking views of coastal wildlife, while Mammoth Lakes and the John Muir Wilderness trails offer high-altitude hikes.

While it’s less likely to have wildfires here, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Which leads us to our next point. 

5.  Always Check the Weather

Fires aren’t the only inclement “weather” that you need to keep tabs on when you’re on the trail. It’s equally important to know about storms and heat waves that may affect your trip. During a wildfire, knowing which way the wind is blowing and if there are any forecasted storms, can help you escape a dangerous situation. 

But checking the weather doesn’t solve the root of the problem: How do you know if you’re in the path of a wildfire, while you’re on the trail?

6.  Enable Wildfire Alerts

Knowing where fires are happening is helpful for when you’re planning a trip. There’s no need to put yourself in harm’s way. But it’s also helpful if you’re on the trail and a wildfire ignites near you. 

One of the most helpful features in the Pathloom App is the ability to enable wildfire alerts. Because when you have up-to-date information on the fire’s behavior, you have more time and information to get you out of harm's way faster.

But until the app gets here, you can use the National Risk Index which has a map showing areas with the highest risk for wildfires. Or use the online tracker from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) which shows you a map of fire activity across the country. 

InciWeb also publishes a map of the country’s Air Quality Index so you can avoid hiking in areas with high smoke pollution. 

7.  Have Alternate Trails Marked

If a wildfire does block your route, you’ll need to find a new route that takes you out of the path of the fire. Always pack a map that shows alternate trails. 

It’s important to remember that with wildfires, conditions can change quickly. Even after assessing fire risks and safety resources for potential places to backpack, the speed and direction of wind can affect a wildfire’s speed, size, direction, and intensity. This, of course, makes extinguishing the blaze more difficult for firefighters and gives you less time to evacuate.

Do I Need a Campfire Permit to Have a Fire in California?

California has specific regulations for campfires and cooking stoves. You can get a campfire permit from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the Bureau of Land Management, or the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture. Or you check out CAL FIRE’s Permit page to also get your free campfire or burn permit. 

What to Do if You’re Caught in a Wildfire?

Despite your best preparations, you’re caught in a wildfire. What do you do? Can you hide from fire? 

Yes, you can. 

Your first course of action is to navigate out of the fire’s path or get around the fire to already burned ground. Watch the smoke to determined where the fire is most likely to move toward. If you have cell service, you can look up data on wind direction and speed too. Use your map to find the best alternate route that takes you out of the fire’s path. 

If a fire is actively coming your way, don’t wait. Leave your gear behind, cover your nose and mouth, and head to a fire-resistant area like:

A grouping of boulders
A body of water that you can submerge yourself in
Bear depressions or trenches in the ground 
Or a downhill valley

These are the safest places to be during a wildfire. Cover your body and protect your face by lying face down. 

The next safest place to be is where the fire has already been. So, if you don’t have any of the above options, try and find a path to charred ground.

Conclusion: Stay Safe during Wildfire Season in California

Even during wildfire season, you can enjoy the breathtaking landscapes of California. By hiking in fire resistant areas that you find along the coast or at higher elevations, you can relish your backpacking adventure in a safer environment. 

You can avoid fire risks by practicing these fire safety tips and by knowing what to do if a wildfire starts getting close. 

At Pathloom, we want you to stay safe in the backcountry. 

That’s why we’re creating a trip planning app specifically for backpackers. Pathloom helps you discover trails, plan your itinerary, get permits, and receive real-time updates while on the trail. All from one app.

As if that isn’t awesome enough, hands down my favorite feature is the retro-reflective thread detail for locating it at night with a headlamp - no more stumbling in the darkness when nature calls!

A REI gift card is the ultimate stocking stuffer for backpacking enthusiasts. You really cannot go wrong with this versatile gift, as it offers the perfect opportunity for them to gear up with top-quality equipment, ranging from innovative gadgets to durable outdoor apparel. This ensures they'll be well-equipped and ready for their next adventure in the great outdoors.

Weighing under 2 ounces and providing 2,000 liters of clean drinking water, it's a must-have for backpackers.

Unsure whether to use tablets, filters or UV purification? Check out our water purification blog to find out which is right for you.

Notice Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Bar $42.50
Lather them in luxury this holiday season with French green and antioxidant-rich matcha green tea compact bars. Aside from smelling incredible, these little delights will provide 50-75 washes and are color-safe, vegan &amp; cruelty-free. Weighing only 2 ounces each and at 2 inches in diameter, these bars are ideal for stashing in their backpack without taking up as much space as liquid shampoos and conditioners.

But if you ask me, it's not just about the stuff. Sometimes, the most incredible presents are the memories we cook up together. Some of the best gifts I have ever received have been experiences with my friends and family. A surprise weekend camping trip or backpacking through the jungle. Those are the memories that stick around, creating a highlight reel of stories I'll be telling until the end of time (and probably blogging about so keep an eye on this space!).

Now, I want to hear from you! Let me know in the comments what’s on your wishlist this year?

 Editor's Note: This article, originally published in 2021 and updated in 2022 has been refreshed as of April 2023 to reflect a current schedule of meteor showers for the duration of this year. We'll continue to update this post as needed to provide you with the most relevant information regarding upcoming sky events worth staying up late for!
 
Meteor showers are some of the most exciting and breathtaking sky events you can witness - but if you’re not careful, they can be easy to miss! That’s why we at Pathloom decided to put together a comprehensive list of every meteor shower that will be occurring for the remainder of 2023 - beginning with the Lyrid shower that peaks next week! We're also including dates for the two total lunar eclipses (May and October), as well as the four Supermoons of the year (July, August (x2), and September), when the proximity of the full moon makes it appear larger in the night sky than at any other time! Get your cameras, binoculars, and/or telescopes ready! 

Viewing conditions vary around the world, and some meteor showers are much more visible from the Southern Hemisphere. However, at this point in our company’s lifecycle the overwhelming majority of Pathloom’s community is US-based, so we tried to list the best locations to view each shower domestically. We hope to provide a more international perspective in coming years, but for now we’ll focus on our local readership.

So mark your calendars and get trip planning! Remember that you’ll only need to find a location without much light pollution, and arrive with enough time to find a good view of the sky to see something truly beautiful. You can use this tool to find the best places to stargaze near you - and if you’re new to stargazing, check out our article on planetary conjunctions for a more comprehensive look on how to view constellations! Remember, meteor showers are typically named after the constellations that they appear closest to, so for the most ideal views find that constellation and set your sights there. Good luck, and don’t forget to make a wish!

Outdoor Safety: How Wilderness First Aid Could Save Your Life...It Saved His
Why a Wilderness First Aid Course Is Worth Your Time

Wilderness First Aid Training in Bear Creek Lake State Park
He shivers uncontrollably huddled under a thin, reflective emergency blanket that one of the Scout leaders took out of their wilderness first aid kit. But he knows it's too late. He ignored the classic signs, and now he's blue as a Smurf.

He could just hear what his dad was going to say when he got home. 

"You should know better. Outdoor safety. Wilderness first aid. What do you think I've been teaching you all these years?"

Yep, he was in for a lecture alright. And what made it all the more frustrating was that his dad was right. 

Here he was: 17 years old and an Eagle Scout. He was supposed to be leading the Tenderfoots on their first big trek. He'd even hiked this part of the Appalachian Trail before.

But this time it was different. 

This time he was wet. He had no sleeping bag. And no tent. The only food he brought was light rations of Ramen noodles – it was only supposed to be a three-day hike after all. Why get bogged down with comforts? Whatever discomfort came he would only have to endure for two nights.

But in opting for less gear, he neglected what scoutmasters have been teaching young scouts for generations. 

The first rule of outdoor safety is: be prepared. 

What's the Difference between Wilderness First Aid and Basic First Aid Skills?

The difference between Wilderness First Aid and Basic First Aid skills is stark.

Basic First Aid teaches...

Check your surroundings for danger: If the victim is in danger or in a harm inducing environment, move them to a safe location.  
Determine if it's an emergency situation: Talk to the victim. See what hurts. What are their symptoms? Based on their responses, make a decision to call 911 or not. 
Call 911: This is the easy. The operator will tell you what to do from here. 
Wait for help: Treat the patient until help arrives. 

Okay, that may be a slight oversimplification, but the main crux is this.

Help is coming. You don't have to know how to distinguish between a fracture and a bad sprain because the paramedics are on their way. You just have to keep the patient safe and comfortable.

Well, if Wilderness Survival and Basic First Aid had a baby, it would be Wilderness First Aid. 

Wilderness First Aid teaches...

Check your surroundings: Yep, it's the same first step as before.
Assess your patient: That's right. This is your problem. You're more than a day from any help reaching you possibly longer. If that bone is broken, then you may have to set it. 
Treat your patient: Your companion is hurt, you're stuck in the backcountry, and you have to know how to make seriously, life or death decisions in a timely manner.

That's a big responsibility. Are you prepared for that? 

How to Get Wilderness First Aid Certified? 

Taking a Wilderness First Aid course prepares you for situations you're likely to run into if you spend any time in the backcountry.

Now, you've been thinking about taking a Wilderness First Aid course for a long time. I mean, you've been through wilderness survival stuff, and you know basic first aid. How is a Wilderness First Aid course any different?

There are two ways to get Wilderness First Aid certified: In-person or online. Both are 16-hour courses. Let's see which is best for you.

In-Person Wilderness First Aid Certification
Outdoor sports shops and Clubs like REI offer in-person training. These events usually include:

Course material: A reference book and quick reference guide that you can take with on the trail if you choose. I don't know about you, but if I don't use a skill regularly my memory gets fuzzy. Having a resource to reference in an emergency, gives me confidence in my decisions. (National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) also sells a good one here.)
An in-person instructor: It's invaluable to be able to talk through scenarios and have your questions answered by a professional.
Hands-on application: Yep, get ready to handle some bloody scalps and split broken bones because this is where you walk through your decision-making process and apply what you've learned in the course.
A certificate: Your Wilderness First Aid certificate is good for two years.

Expect your in-person training to take 2-3 days depending on your facilitator.  

Online Wilderness First Aid Certification

You can also get certified online through a number of different online course companies and organizations such as the Red Cross or NOLS.

Buyer Beware: Not all online courses offer a certificate. Many of them are Wilderness First Aid overviews, which leave out the practical parts of the course. The full course will have you print out a certificate at the end. 

If you're getting your Wilderness First Aid certification to fulfill a requirement for a certain trip or as a leader of a youth group like the Scouts, be sure to check your organization's specific requirements.

The full online certifications include:

Course material: You receive PDFs that you can print out at home to have on hand.
Instruction videos: You have unlimited access to these videos, so you can watch them at your leisure. How long your access lasts depends on your provider.
A printable certificate: You can print this out to have on file in case anyone asks for your credentials. It's still good for two years.

Your online course can take as little as a day, if you decide to binge watch videos. But for proper knowledge retention, try to stretch it out to a few days or even a week. 

You may have noticed that somethings missing. No practical scenarios. 

Oh, they show you the practical application of what you go over in the modules, but you don't have to work through the process yourself. The learning experience is vastly different when you see someone bleeding and in pain on a screen while someone else helps them versus when they're right in front of you, and it's your responsibility to help. 

In my personal experience, having that practical exercise of problem solving, and then acting on my decisions was the more valuable part of the course. It was where I learned to...

Trust my knowledge: So I can confidently speak up when I see someone in need. 
Stick with my decisions: Because sometimes people argue with you – especially if they have heat stroke.
Not stare at blood: I will get lightheaded and start to pass out.
Stay calm: It’s true. Calm is contagious. If you stay calm, then those around you will feel safe and stay calm.

And those things aren't taught or shown, they're experienced. 

So, if you have a choice, I highly recommend doing the in-person course. Because a Wilderness First Aid course is about more than knowing what you should do, it's about using what you've learned. 

Are There Free Wilderness First Aid Training Opportunities?

Most of the online course options are, in fact, free. The Red Cross charges you $0 to get certified. So if you’ve already done the in-person training and you just need a refresher or a recertification, then the online option is perfect for you.

If you've never faced a medical emergency or never taken a first aid course before, I highly recommend paying for the in-person training.

Because when you’re responsible for a group of boys hiking the Appalachian Trail, you want to be prepared to make hard decisions that could save a life.

Outdoor Safety and Wilderness First Aid Saves Lives

He's only getting worse. You gave him some of your dry clothes – your only other set actually. He's huddled together with some other boys to try and generate heat. But what he needs for this drizzling cold rain to stop...and a fire.

Not the little stoves you all brought to boil water, but a real get-me-warm fire.

You've been trying for over an hour and even with those waterproof matches you can't get it to light. Everything is too wet, and there's no way to keep the fire totally out of the rain here. It's time to change tactics. 

Help isn't coming to you, but you could still get him to help. It's time to get him moving.

Getting him moving is the last way you know to get him to generate heat. 

You talk to the other Scout leaders, and they agree. You and two other older scouts will help get him off the mountain and to some help, while the rest of the boys rest and join you the next day. 

You walk over to him, "Alright son, it's time to get up. Pack you gear in my bag. We're heading down the mountain. I've got to get you moving, but I don't want you carrying a full pack on a slippery trail the way you're feeling."

He nods, relieved to be moving.

After repacking and throwing an emergency poncho over the kid, you're hiking off the mountain...in the dark...while it's raining...with a clumsy, hypothermic kid. 

But what else could you do? 

FAQ:  Outdoor Safety Questions

How Often Do You Actually Use Wilderness First Aid?
I've personally used what I’ve learned several times over the years and never regretted getting trained. But really, this is the wrong question to ask.

The "pay-off" in a Wilderness First Aid course is NOT how many times have you used it? I hope you never have to use it!

But, instead, the one time it matters, will you be prepared to cope with the emergency or not?

How Much Does a Wilderness First Aid Course cost?
The Wilderness First Aid Course cost varies. If you choose to do the online course, it's $0.
If you opt for the in-person training, it depends on your provider. REI charges around $330. 

If you’re a part of a scout group that wants to get certified, then contact your council. They can put you in touch with an instructor directly. And there’s usually a group rate as well.

What's Some Essential Wilderness First Aid Equipment?
Obviously, your first aid kit should already have most of what you need, so leaving out the basic first aid stuff. 

Moleskin / Blister Treatment
Water purification tablets
Anti-Diarrheal Medicine
Electrolyte Packets
Irrigation Syringe
Liquid Bandage
Personal Locator Beacon
Emergency Blanket
A deck of cards (yes, I'm serious. They help keep someone with a head injury awake.)
Tampons (to absorb excessive bleeding from deep wounds.)
Snake bite kit

This is by no means a comprehensive list, and the list should be customized to your needs and climate as medical needs vary from person to person, environment to environment. 

And if you're interested in buying one for your next trip NOLS has one already put together for you here.

Conclusion: Be Prepared

The young man in our story isn't fake. He was a friend of mine. 

(No, I'm not going to tell you his name because we all do stupid stuff at 17 that we wouldn't do a few years later.) 

And yes, his Scoutmaster got him to help in time, and he survived. 

But it was a near thing. If his scoutmaster hadn't been wilderness first aid certified, it's likely that...

He wouldn't understand the progression of hypothermia. 
He wouldn't understand how close the young man was to the point of no return. 
And wouldn't have been willing to take the necessary risk (a night hike on a rainy trial with a clumsy, hypothermic kid) to save his life. 

If you plan on spending time in the backcountry, away from the noise of modern life, do it! There's so much to experience and enjoy out there. Hope for the best. Expect it even, but plan for the worst. 

Explore safely. Be prepared for when things don't go according to plan, when someone gets hurt, or when you come upon someone outside your group who needs your help.

Skiing and snowboarding may be the two most popular winter sports in the world, but they are certainly among the most expensive as well. Both sports not only require extensive winter gear and lift tickets, but also accommodations when visiting resorts. Heading to iconic resorts, on either the east or west coast, typically means planning flights and a multiple night stay at, or nearby, the mountains - neither of which tend to be cheap. 

After accommodations and gear, lift tickets tend to be the most expensive aspect of the two sports. Lift tickets typically cost well over $100 per person each day, and can even exceed $200 per day for an ever-increasing number of popular resorts such as Vail during the peak season. Although the passes require a hefty up-front purchase, if you plan on going skiing frequently most of these passes pay for themselves within several ski trips. After deciding where you want to ski, and how often you want to ski, purchasing one of the four season tickets we outline below is the best way to make your upcoming season affordable as well as enjoyable! Most of these passes go on sale annually in the Spring, and are only available until the very beginning of that year’s skiing/snowboarding season. 

The discounts are extreme, but the tradeoff is you have to purchase them long before the season in question begins! Fortunately, most of these passes offer payment plans to help alleviate the financial burden, as well as insurance plans in the event something happens that  interrupts or prevents your ski season from happening. 

The two most popular ski passes are the Ikon and Epic. 

Editor's note, this article is an update to last year's Guide to Multi Mountain Ski Passes, with new information for the upcoming 2023-4 season. The article was originally written by Pathloom intern Abby Voce, and she included so much useful information that we wanted to keep everything as intact as possible for this updated edition. Read on for information about what these Ski Passes include, how to purchase them, and how to get the most for your money when skiing next season!

IKON PASS

2023-2024 Season Passes Now Available!

The Ikon pass, as its name suggests, is definitely the most iconic pass on this list. This pass offers access to 54 ski resorts, most of which are world-renowned destinations, for $1,159. If you are looking to ski the ‘big boys’ with lots of options (primarily in the western US) - this is the pass for you. This pass includes access to over a dozen international locations as well for those interested in taking their ski vacations overseas (or up North!)

Ikon offers a range of plan options for skiiers of all budget and interest levels, ranging from unlimited access with no blackout dates all the way down to a 2-day pass. Even the less ambitious passes still offer significant savings though - for example the 2-day pass may seem a bit steep at $259, but when you compare it to 2 lift tickets at a resort like Palisades up in Tahoe at $205 per day (even more on the weekends!), you realize that even the base level pass presents a great deal. 
Depending on the level of the Ikon pass, access to each destination ranges from 7 days per resort per season to unlimited access throughout the entire winter. Details and purchasing info for the Ikon pass can be found here.

EPIC PASS 

2023-2024 Season Passes Now Available!

The Epic pass offers access to a wide variety of destinations globally, including many across the United States. Most notably, this pass offers unlimited access to Vail, Telluride, and many other famous destinations throughout the US, for $909. Epic also allows you to pick a pass based on region if you are primarily skiing one area of the country - for substantially less of a financial commitment than a universal pass. Access ranges from 3 days per location to unlimited, depending on the resort. Since I am personally located in Boston and have no plans to ski out West this season, I purchased Epic’s Northeast Value pass. The Epic pass provides the most resort options for Midwest and East coast skiing. 

The Epic Pass boasts a wide array of European partner resorts, as well as free access to locations in Canada, Japan, Australia, and more.

Although the argument between Ikon and Epic is highly debated, it truly comes down to which mountains you want to ski, and which you will ski most frequently throughout the season. After roughly outlining my plans for the season, I researched which pass had the most destinations around the region in which I was going to do the majority of my skiing. Although I purchased the Northeast Value pass this season, I will also be able to enjoy discounted buddy lift tickets when skiing out West with either Epic or Ikon pass customers!

Epic and Ikon passes give you the best value for your buck, but the price tags aren’t for everyone. The Mountain Collective and Indy Pass, outlined below, are great for shorter ski trips, and don’t require nearly as large of a purchase.

MOUNTAIN COLLECTIVE SEASON PASS

2023-2024 Season Passes Now Available!

If you're planning multiple 2-3 day weekend ski trips at several different destinations throughout the season - the Mountain Collective will likely be your best choice. This pass offers 2-day access to 24 collective resort destinations such as Aspen and Big Sky - a total of 48 days for $570 (less expensive options available for Teens and Children). Additionally, the pass offers 50% off all additional days at these destinations with no blackout dates. Furthermore, this pass is currently offering an Early Bird special where you can add a third free day for your favorite resort! (Limited time offer)

I would recommend this pass if you are traveling full-time, for cost-effective access to a variety of resorts. Keep in mind though - unlike other passes this one is an 'all sales final' deal - meaning if injury or life in general prevents you from utilizing the pass during the season, no refunds will be issued. It would be wise to consider purchasing an insurance package along with this pass in case disaster were to occur.

More details on the Mountain Collective pass can be found here.

INDY SKI PASS

2023-2024 Season Passes now available to returning customers!

Waitlist available for new customers

The Indy pass is perfect for those skiers who want to explore less popular, authentic and independent resorts. The pass offers 2-day access to 120 famous off-the-beaten-path resorts located throughout the United States, Canada and Japan, for $279. In addition, you can purchase a ticket for a third day at each resort for 25% off the usual daily rate. 

Skiing less popular mountains can be a viable alternative to crowded resorts, especially during the peak holiday season. The Indy+ pass is available with no blackout dates -  you can learn more about the different pass options here. This is also the only pass on this list that is available for sale throughout the entire season, so you can decide if you want to purchase the pass mid-season if a ski opportunity arises. 

 
Keep up to date with the individual websites for each pass in the coming weeks for deals and discounts. It is important to note that once the season begins, all passes (except the Indy Pass) will no longer be available to purchase. For each pass there are a variety of Military, College, Youth, and Senior discounts available as well. Check each website for details on blackout date restrictions for each pass - those could severely impact your travel plans!

How relevant is bushcraft knowledge today? This is a particularly crucial question as hiking and trekking grow in popularity. Hiking was cited to be the second most popular outdoor sport in North America, with 75% of men and 70% of women picking it as their favorite outdoor activity after running.

This trend is echoed internationally as officials attempt to cater to the increase in demand by providing safer options in the wilderness. Biodiversity hotspots like Mt. Kitanglad in the Philippines offer bunk beds at the peak for climbers, much like the Kitadake no Koya mountain hut does for adventurous travelers at Mt. Kita in Japan. The Under-the-Rim Trail at Bryce Canyon even takes care to include a free shuttle service (with shuttle tracker!) near Rainbow Point all to make sure that visitors get home safely.

However, no matter where your trail or trek, no matter what safety options are provided, it never hurts to be prepared - you never know what can happen while out in the wilderness! An injured man, notably an experienced hiker, spent 14 days stranded in Santa Fe National Forest before he was found by another hiker by a creek. The hiker would not have survived for that long if he hadn’t known some survival basics, such as prioritizing his liquid intake by situating himself by a nearby stream and relying on his filtering water bottle.

As outdoor activities become more popular, so too does the importance of survival and bushcraft basics grow. Whether you’re staying on trail or exploring off the beaten path, be prepared for any survival situation in advance with our basic bushcraft tips below.

Prioritize Hydration
A dehydrated body cannot last more than three days outdoors, which is why knowing where to secure a reliable source of water is essential bushcraft knowledge. The injured hiker cited earlier was lucky to have a filtering water bottle on hand. If you don’t have a filtering bottle on hand, try to follow The Manual’s tips for creating an emergency water filtration device. Items like spare clothing or a neck scarf can be made into a simple filter for sediment removal, and you can then boil the water to kill off bacteria after filtering out that large sediment.

Creating fire in the wild is an advanced skill that takes even the most rugged bushcraft experts years to perfect. Without fire to boil off bacteria in natural water sources, you must maximize what you have available. 

You can create two containers with bamboo or a hollow log, and fill one with water. Put a piece of cloth over the other container, and layer this with pebbles before filtering your water and pouring this over the stones. After you've done this, remove the pebbles and put a finer material, like sand, on top of the cloth to filter the water again. 

This method isn’t perfect, but when done properly the side effects of water-borne pathogens can take at least a week to start impacting you - buying you valuable time to find help or get to safety.

Building a Fire

Fire can be used to boil water, cook food, scare off predators, smoke bugs away, help you stay warm, signal for help, and even cauterize wounds. This makes building fire a critical bushcraft skill to have to heavily increase your chances of survival.

It is no easy feat to build a fire from scratch, but it isn't impossible with grit and the right materials. Gather everything you'll need ahead of time. This includes the tinder, which could comprise of either dry grasses or pine bark, and the kindling, consisting of wooden branches in different small sizes. 

You can attempt friction-based fire making with the hand drill, where you build your tinder nest and place this into a notch within your primary piece of fireboard. Carve another small depression adjacent to this notch. Afterwards, you can take your second piece of wood, or your spindle, which should be about 2 feet long, and position this into the depression. Start rolling the spindle between your hands to maintain pressure on your fireboard.

Doing this consistently and persistently by rubbing your hands from the top of the spindle down while spinning will generate heat from the friction. Once a glowing ember is formed, you must tap the fireboard to drop this ember onto your tinder nest. From there, you can gently blow and feed more tinder or kindling to grow your fire. Blowing into a hollow reed to concentrate the airflow can be incredibly useful for this step.

Editor’s note - we are in no way, shape, or form denying that building a fire using these methods isn’t an incredible pain in the !&amp;$#%. Therefore we at Pathloom strongly advocate bringing multiple fire sources with you whenever exploring the outdoors - lighters, matches, flint &amp; tinder, etc. Having both a fire source and a failsafe with you at all times will save you tons of precious time should you ever become stranded in the wilderness for any reason.

Bad Shelter is Better than No Shelter
You can only survive for 3 hours without shelter in harsh environments. Exposing your body to extreme elements makes you more vulnerable to life-threatening conditions such as hypothermia or heatstroke. 

If you are stranded without a tent, create a rectangular frame with logs or other materials, and make use of branches, leaves, and even moss to fill this up. The leaves and absorbent moss can act as a roof and barrier to rain, but utilizing large rocks or fallen logs to act as a natural wall is even better to help stabilize your makeshift shelter. This can help keep you dry, protect you from the cold (or heat!), and even shield you from the sight of wild animals.

Edible Plants - Photo Credit: Masterclass (blame them not us)


Edible (and Absolutely Inedible) Plants

There are many plants that are safe for consumption in the wild. Aggregate berries found throughout the world, such as raspberries or mulberries, are 99% edible. There are also edible weeds like chickweed, dandelion, clover, and more.

However, a single mistake can be dangerous and lead to plant poisoning - so be incredibly careful when foraging. Telltale signs of poisonous plants include milky sap, fine hairs or spines, umbrella-shaped flower clusters, and waxy leaves. Never risk eating something that you aren’t 100% sure is safe. According to Healthline, survival time may extend up to 2 to 3 months without food, as long as you have a reliable source of clean water.

First Aid Survival Skills
Familiarize yourself with natural first aid remedies that are abundant in the wild as well. In the wilderness, a simple cut can expose you to a wide variety of harmful bacteria. This can infect your wound and contaminate your body. 

Natural News highlights pine sap as a natural antiseptic that can be used to disinfect cuts with its antibacterial, astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. Otherwise, we’ve featured butterbur or stinging nettles in Pollen Problems that can act as natural remedies for allergies to prevent your symptoms from worsening even without an antihistamine. 

Just be sure you know exactly what to look for - applying the wrong plant product in the wrong manner can make things way worse!

Be Cautious of Insects

Insects can host a wide range of diseases that your body may not have the natural resistance for. A single mosquito bite alone can carry the risk of malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, and more. 

Creating fire or shelter can help, as previously referenced, and you can also look for wild plants that contain natural bug repelling compounds. Examples include pawpaw, which is commonly found along rivers and waterways throughout eastern North America, or catnip, which can be found throughout the more temperate areas of the country. 

Otherwise, covering yourself with mud can be a drastic but helpful solution for certain bug-infested environments.

Whether you’re an avid sky watcher or or just head out to catch the occasional meteor shower, there is a good chance you heard about 2020's especially vivid “Christmas Star”, the Jupiter and Saturn’s Great Conjunction on December 21st. The event made national news as the two planets hadn't been this visible from Earth since the year 1623. What few people know is that planetary conjunctions are fairly common between other planets and astronomical objects. They may not all be worthy of the title of “Great”, but these events are quite interesting regardless. You’ll be able to see two or more of these stunning astronomical objects — most of which are not usually visible to the naked eye — and their orbits will be so close together that they’ll appear within the same lens of a telescope! Want to know more? Pathloom’s Official Guide to Planet Conjunctions is here for everything you need to know about these astronomical wonders!

Editor's note, this article is an update to our Guide to Planetary Conjunctions from previous years, with new information for 2023. The article was originally written by Pathloom intern Justine Imburgio, and she included so much useful information that we wanted to keep everything as intact as possible for this updated edition. Read on for information about what Planetary Conjunctions are, and how best to view and/or photograph them.

What are Planetary Conjunctions?

Astronomical Conjunctions occur when two astronomical objects - such as planets, stars, moons, or the sun - align in the sky, creating an illusion that they are close together when in reality they are thousands of miles apart. The objects are bright, so you’ll be able to see them with the naked eye, but with binoculars or a telescope, you can view amazing details - such as the rings of Saturn, or the moons surrounding these planets!

How to View Planetary Conjunctions

Viewing planetary conjunctions is easy, but it does require a bit of planning. First, know when to arrive at your location. These events often occur all day and night, but they’re typically most visible about 45 minutes after sunset. Be aware of the sun’s afterglow, however, which may wash out the view. If this happens, you may have to wait a little longer to see anything.

Also, be mindful of the placement of the objects in the sky. It’d be disappointing to go out of your way to see an astronomical wonder that is hidden behind trees from your viewpoint because it’s lower in elevation than you expected! The ideal viewing locations have a horizon that is as clear as possible, such as open fields and beaches. If these flat areas aren’t available to you, look for high vantage points like balconies, hills, or anywhere else that can provide an elevated view of the horizon. When you get there, apps such as Star Walk 2 are a great help to ensure that you’re looking in the right direction. This app maps out the entire sky so you can view the locations of planets, constellations, and moons in real time, directly through your phone. 

If you live in an urban area, you’re going to want to find somewhere with as little light pollution as possible. Luckily, you won’t have to go as far as you’d necessarily think. The suburbs just outside your city often work well enough, depending on the brightness of the planets. I was able to see the Great Conjunction last December just while driving around in the suburbs outside Philadelphia! Alternatively, if you’re feeling adventurous, use the conjunction as an excuse to go camping, or take a night hike into the wilderness for optimal viewing conditions.

The one factor you won’t be able to plan for, but arguably the most important, is the presence of a clear sky. Planets are seen best without overcast clouding your experience, so try to avoid nights that will definitely be rainy or foggy. Planetary conjunctions also vary in brightness so they might not as easily visible at first - but don’t lose hope! Many of these events last for several days, so you may be able to try again the following day when viewing conditions have improved. Although rare, some conjunctions are even bright enough to be visible in the daytime!

Photographing Planetary Conjunctions

If you like to take pictures, you may want to try your hand at photographing the planetary conjunctions you see. Astronomical objects photograph best in dark skies with little light pollution surrounding it, but they can sometimes come through in front of colorful sunsets. Staying out long enough to capture your planets in both sunset and night sky settings can make for some very interesting shots! If you do go with the dark sky option but want your planets to come off as brighter, see if your phone has a “night mode”. This will stabilize long exposure and make your darks look darker, providing a better contrast to the stars and planets . If using a DSLR camera, you can stabilize this exposure manually by using a tripod to get a sharper image. You can further sharpen your image by utilizing the Manual Focus mode. Finally, experiment with different lenses. A wide lens will allow you to capture more of the foreground and scenery of your viewing location, while a telephoto lens will give you a clearer, zoomed in shot. Capturing these events can be a challenging, but extremely rewarding experience!

Important Things to Know Before Hiking in San Diego

Hiking Seasons in San Diego

San Diego has great weather year-round, so you can hike any time of year. However, the best time to hike is in the spring and fall, when the temperatures are milder. In the summer months, it's best to hike early in the morning or evening to avoid the heat of the day. That is certainly not the case in the wintertime, when temperatures are far more moderate and even quite chilly at elevation. 

How To Prepare For Hiking in San Diego

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced hiker, it's important to be prepared before you hit the trail. Here are some tips:
Wear comfortable shoes and clothes that you can move in.
Pack plenty of water and snacks, and a first-aid kit.
Bring an offline map of the area, and know your general route before you start hiking.
Be aware of your surroundings, and stay on the trail at all times.
Leave no trace: take all your trash with you when you leave.

Safety Tips For Hiking in San Diego

As with any outdoor activity, there are a few safety precautions you should take when hiking. First, always let someone know where you're going and when you'll be back. Second, carry a first-aid kit and know how to use it. And finally, stay on the trail and be aware of your surroundings. If you see something dangerous, don't hesitate to turn back.

Now that you know the most important things about hiking in San Diego, it's time to hit the trails! So put on your hiking boots, grab your water bottle, and explore all the outdoor glory that our beautiful city has to offer!

Groups and Organizations For Hiking in San Diego

If you're looking for some company on the trail, there are plenty of groups and organizations that offer communal hiking trip coordination in San Diego.

The Sierra Club offers day hikes and backpacking trips for all levels of hiking experience. They also have a youth program for kids ages 14-18.
The American Hiking Society leads group hikes throughout the year, while also offering volunteer opportunities to help maintain trails.
REI offers a wide variety of guided hikes and outdoor activities, ranging from beginner-friendly walks to far more challenging hikes.

Hiking in San Diego With Dogs

Many of the trails in San Diego are dog-friendly, so you can bring your furry friend along on your hike. Just be sure to pack water and food for them, and clean up after them if they make a mess.

Malibu Creek State Park Campground is a beautiful and peaceful campsite located in the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains. The grounds offer a variety of amenities, including flush toilets, hot showers, and a camp store. The campsites are spacious and well-maintained, and each includes a fire ring and picnic table.

Deep Creek Hot Springs Campground, found in the San Bernardino National Forest, is best known for its natural hot springs, which are a perfect way to relax after a long day of exploring the surrounding wilderness. The hot springs are located on private land, but they are open to the public for a small entry fee of $5 per person. 

The campsites at Deep Creek are spacious and clean, and there is plenty of room for both tent camping and RVs. This remote and peaceful campground is an excellent choice for anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life without straying too far outside city limits.

Horse Flats Campground is a beautiful spot in the Angeles National Forest, boasting breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains and forests. With a total of 26 campsites, it's a perfect place for both solo travelers and groups. Be sure to arrive early during peak times or consider camping on off-days to secure your spot, as space here is limited as compared to other campgrounds on this list. 

The campground itself has potable water and barbecue grills available for guests, making it a convenient and comfortable spot to pitch your tent. Horse Flats also has a ton of nearby trails leading to various mountain peaks and scenic vistas. We recommend bringing sturdy hiking boots and plenty of water, as the terrain can be strenuous. 
 
Best For Beach Access: Refugio State Beach Campground

Refugio State Beach Campground is a hidden gem located on the California coastline, just north of Santa Barbara. This campground is notable for its beautiful surroundings, with picturesque views of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent mountains. 

The campground is very spacious, accommodating tents, RVs, and trailers alike. Each site has a picnic table and fire pit, making it easy to enjoy a peaceful evening by the ocean. Refugio State Beach Campground’s biggest highlight is its proximity to the beach, with a direct access path leading to the sandy shore. Here, you can spend your days swimming, surfing, or just soaking up the sun. 
 
Best For Sunsets: Leo Carrillo State Park Campground

Leo Carrillo State Park Campground is a charming spot along the Pacific Coast Highway in California. Visitors to the campsite can take advantage of hot showers and flushing toilets, and other useful amenities. 

Aside from ample sunbathing, swimming, and surfing opportunities, this campground is famous for great hikes, with several trails leading through the park's scenic canyons and along the coastline. We recommend trying your hand at tide-pooling, or exploring the park's numerous caves and sea arches. For an unparalleled view, pitch your tent facing west to catch the sunset before bed - you won't regret it! 
 
Best For Families: Moro Campground

The Sycamore Canyon Campground in Point Mugu State Park is a fan-favorite for a reason.  There is a long list of activities to try while you’re there, from hiking and biking to picnicking and horseback riding. 

Visitors can expect several campsites equipped with fire rings, picnic tables, and nearby restrooms. The campground’s main attraction is the Sycamore Canyon Trail, a moderate to strenuous hike that offers impressive views of the Pacific Ocean and the surrounding canyon.

Campers can also take advantage of the park's beach access, where they can swim, surf, or relax on the sand. A trip to the Sycamore Canyon Campground wouldn't be complete without a visit to Point Mugu State Park's historic World War II-era military facilities, which are open for self-guided tours.
 
Best For Scenic Views: Chilao Campground

The campground at Chilao is surrounded by beautiful forests, making it an ideal location for hiking, mountain biking, backpacking, and birdwatching activities. The Pacific Crest Trail, which passes through this area, spans over 2,000 miles between Mexico and Canada. The 176-mile section that runs through the campground offers particularly unbeatable views of the forest. 
 One helpful tip for those planning to visit Chilao Campground is to book ahead, as it is quite a popular spot. Those living in Los Angeles know the best campsites near me fill up quickly during peak season. 
 
Best For Extended Stay: Buckhorn Campground

Like all outdoor gear, the best stove for backpacking is a highly personal choice, and will depend on your environment, trip duration, and overall preferences. 

Different backpacking stoves vary dramatically in price, fuel sources, features, and weight. Some specialize in boiling water blazingly fast, some have features ideal for properly cooking food, and others are designed to be reliable even through the worst conditions imaginable. 

Picking the “best” backpacking stove means picking the best stove for you and your particular needs. This guide will help you do that. We dive into the specific stove features to consider, the different types of backpacking stoves, and share our favorite stoves for every kind of backpacking adventure.

Backpacking Stoves vs. Camping Stoves

Stoves are a staple of any car camping setup. So what makes stoves for backpacking so much different? 

In short, the difference is portability and efficiency. Backpacking stoves have only a single burner, and are as lightweight and compact as possible. Many are designed to boil water quickly, offering few opportunities for simmering and temperature control.

Typical camping stoves are for car camping in developed campgrounds, where you can drive right into your campsite with all your gear in tow. They generally feature two burners, are fueled by propane, and operate more like the stovetop in your kitchen: they let you effectively boil water, simmer stews, and flip flapjacks. Camping stoves are versatile, but are too heavy and bulky for backcountry camping when you are hauling all your gear in a backpack.

Backpacking Stove Features to Consider

All backpacking stoves are light and packable for travel in the backcountry, but different models will still offer their own particular sets of advantages and disadvantages. 

Here are the most important features to consider:

Efficiency and Boil Time: Backpacking stoves often use the British Thermal Unit (BTU) to measure efficiency. The BTU represents the heat required to warm one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Generally, a higher BTU indicates faster boil times and greater fuel consumption.

Wind Resistance: Well-designed stoves can balance fuel efficiency and boil times with wind-resistant features. Windscreens, aerodynamic designs, and auto-relighting burners will keep stoves burning effectively and consistently.

Temperature Control: Many backpackers only use stoves to boil water for oatmeal, coffee, and dehydrated backpacking meals. So, some backpacking stoves focus on boiling water quickly and efficiently, but do not give you much control over cooking or simmering “real” meals. More involved cooking requires a stove with good temperature control.
 Weight and Packed Size: Almost all backpacking stoves weigh less than a pound, and many can pack up to fit right inside your kettle or pot. Ultralight, minimal options, like alcohol stoves, can weigh as little as an ounce or two. Integrated canister stoves and liquid fuel stoves will be heavier, but are far more versatile and efficient. (We’ll dive deeper into these different stove types a bit later.)

Ignition: Backpacking stoves require an external ignition source, whether it be matches, a lighter, or even a flint striker. You should always carry two ignition sources with you. Store them separately and in Ziploc bags. Having a stove, fuel, and ingredients for a delicious meal - but no way to make any of it useful - is an experience we would not wish upon anyone.

Backpacking Stove Types

Most stoves for backpacking fit into five general categories. Each category has particular strengths and weaknesses, making them better suited to different environments, trip lengths, and experience levels. 

Foreseeing what kind of backpacking trips you’ll likely be undertaking will help you find the best stove for your needs.

Screw-On Canister Stoves: These stoves screw right into tiny isobutane fuel canisters, and are probably the most ubiquitous type of backpacking stove. They are light, easy to use, and not overly expensive. The best ones, like the MSR PocketRocket 2, even offer accurate temperature control, making them great for the more involved backcountry chefs.

The downsides of screw-on canister stoves are instability and poor wind resistance. The isobutane canisters themselves are the stove base, and won’t safely support larger pots. This design also means you cannot use a windscreen, as trapping heat around the canister may cause an explosion. The flame will persist through most windy conditions, but boil times increase, demanding more fuel.

Integrated Canister Stoves: By combining stove and cup into one device, integrated canister stoves specialize in one thing: boiling water really fast, and really efficiently. These all-in-one stove systems, like the Jetboil Flash, have a heat exchanger and built-in windscreen to maximize efficiency. They are popular with beginner backpackers seeking a streamlined, easy-to-use cook system. 

They are more expensive and heavier than other canister stoves, and only serve to boil water, but integrated canister stoves are worth it for those seeking simplicity and efficiency.

Remote Canister Stoves: Remote canister stoves share many of the same advantages as their screw-on counterparts, but avoid their pitfalls by using a fuel line to separate fuel and stove. They are more stable, making them better for larger pots and feeding large groups. Separating the fuel from the heat source also allows you to use a windscreen, improving their performance in windy conditions. The best ones, like the MSR Windburner, are ideal for cooking real meals, or boiling water in greater quantities.

The fuel line does make them heavier than other canister stoves and adds another component to maintain and potentially repair.  

Liquid Fuel Stoves: Liquid fuel refers to any fuel that is, well, liquid in form. This includes white gas, kerosene, diesel, and unleaded gasoline. Liquid fuel stoves can work with multiple fuel types. This versatility has made them a favorite for international travel, where you may not know what sort of fuel options will be available from country to country. They are also very repairable and fuel-efficient, ideal for extended treks. Newer models, such as the MSR Dragonfly, also have excellent temperature control. 

The downsides of liquid fuel stoves include slow boil times, their many pieces and components, and a steeper learning curve: you need to compress your fuel bottle manually and prime the stove by lighting fuel in the stove area and letting it burn off. Once a backcountry staple, liquid fuel stoves are now mostly specialist tools for alpinists and trekking guides. 

Alcohol Stoves: Ultralight backpacking enthusiasts are fond of alcohol stoves. They are cheap, have no moving (or breakable) parts, and are incredibly light. They are essentially just a metal container with air holes: you fill it with denatured alcohol, light it, and place a pot on top to boil water as the alcohol burns off.  You can buy an alcohol stove, like the TOAKS Titanium Siphon, or even make your own from an aluminum can. 

These stoves have a long boil time, offer no flame control, and don’t perform well in rainy or windy weather. An open container of flaming alcohol isn’t exactly the safest thing, either - especially not during wildfire season! Overall, alcohol stoves are not a great choice for casual backpackers. They are best for experienced thru-hikers hiking thousands of miles—when ultralight and failsafe gear is a priority.

Choosing the Best Backpacking Stove for You

Hopefully you now have a better idea of the best backpacking stove for your adventures. They will all have pros and cons, depending on the type of trip, so acquiring multiple stoves as you gain experience and begin planning more diverse trips is often the best solution.

If you’re just beginning your backpacking journey, a screw-on or integrated canister stove will serve you well. They are easy to use, affordable, and super packable, providing everything you’ll need for most weekend trips in the woods.

Once your stove and the rest of your backpacking gear are in order, it’s time to get out backpacking! If you’re looking for more help to make your backcountry trips happen, check out how Pathloom’s outdoor trip planning app makes hitting the trails easier than ever!

Taking up a new outdoor sport can be expensive - it is way too easy to get caught up in the gear hype. If you’re a hiker - and/or a runner - and are looking to give trail running a go, it can be hard to know the difference between the specialized running packs and gadgets you need to have versus the gear that would be nice to have.

When it comes to packs, ones made specifically for running do have many advantages, but maybe you’re not ready to drop the cash on something so particular. Although you can technically run with any backpack, all the bouncing, jostling, and chafing you will endure while running with an ill-fitted hiking pack may not leave you as enamored with trail running as you otherwise could be. 

So, whether you’re looking for your first trail running pack, or are already an avid hiker and trail runner, we found the best multi-purpose packs that perform well on hikes, trail runs, scrambles, and beyond.

Hiking Packs vs. Trail Running Packs: What’s the Difference?

Running creates far more movement and momentum than hiking does. Trail running-specific packs tend to be smaller and more form-fitting than “normal” backpacks to prevent this excess bouncing and jostling. They will often utilize vest-like shoulder straps to distribute weight evenly across your back, shoulders, and chest.

Of course, you can run with whatever hiking pack you have, but most of these are designed with slower speeds and higher volumes in mind. Hiking backs tend to be larger and fit more loosely. They often use a waist buckle to distribute weight onto the hips. Hip belts work well for hiking with heavier loads, but can impede your natural running form.

The Best Hiking Packs for Trail Runners

Fortunately, there are several backpacks on the market that offer an ideal middle ground. These five hiking packs have enough capacity to take on any day hike, but are designed with the fit and clever features of running vests, making them excellent for trail running as well.


Black Diamond Distance 15

Black Diamond wanted to design a pack that blurred the boundaries between mountain sports like hiking, scrambling, and trail running, in a way that few other packs do. They succeeded with the Distance 15. The vest-like shoulder straps feature pockets for soft flasks and snacks, and one zippered pocket for your phone. The cavernous 15 L main compartment accommodates a ton of gear. Compression webbing keeps it all secure, even while running. 

Equipped with trekking pole sleeves and ice ax loops, the Distance 15 can even handle technical scrambles deep in the alpine wilderness. If you generally stick to shorter three-season hikes and trail runs, you could instead consider the Distance 8. It has all the features of its larger sibling, just with less volume. It is more akin to a trail running pack you could use for some hiking—rather than the other way around.


Gregory Miwok 12

Unlike the Black Diamond Distance packs, the Gregory Miwok 12 is marketed as a hiking-specific pack, but designed to work well for trail running, too.

The cushioned shoulder straps distribute weight well, and the pack’s dynamic suspension design helps it move with—not against—your body as you run. A dedicated hydration pocket and waist strap pockets allow you to eat and hydrate on the go - a critical component for any trail running-friendly pack.


Gregory Maya 10


The Gregory Maya 10 is the women’s version of the Miwok 12. It has a little less internal volume, but the main pocket still provides more than enough space for extra layers, lunch, and other hiking/trail running essentials. 

Like the Miwok, its bounce-free design and snug fit make for a solid multi-purpose pack.




Salomon XT 10

Salomon is well known for their high-quality running vests. These hyper-minimalist packs have just enough space for the bare essentials, which is perfect for light and fast trail runs, but not so great for hiking.

The Salomon XT 10 bridges that gap. It combines more storage and hiker-friendly features (zippered interior pockets, hydration sleeve) with the vest harness system that makes Salomon’s running packs so good. Pockets in the shoulder straps can store 500ml soft flasks, snacks, and your phone.


Ultimate Direction Fastpack 20

With 20 L of capacity, this pack from Ultimate Direction can do everything from winter hikes to weekend ultralight summer backpacking adventures. The running-style vest has storage for water and snacks. There are side pockets for water bottles, a zippered top pocket, and a large roll-top main compartment.

You don’t need this much volume for your typical trail run, but this spaciousness combined with a runner-friendly design creates the perfect “single-quiver” backpack for year-round hiking, backpacking, climbing, and trail running.

There is also a women’s version of the Fastpack 20, as well as 30 L and 40 L models for longer multi-day trips.

Tips for Running With a Hiking Pack

Here are a few tips to help your hiking pack work well for trail running outings:

Pack Light: Hiking packs have more volume than most trail runs require, making it easy to overpack. Heavy packs negatively affect your running form, so try to be mindful of what you bring. Stick to water, extra layers as needed, a first aid kit, and light, calorie-dense snacks.

Pack Right: Keep heavier items and anything with hard edges at the bottom and middle of your pack, with softer items, like rain gear or a down jacket, closer to your shoulders. Using shoulder and waist straps to store snacks and a hydration bladder or flasks for water will keep you moving, minimizing how often you need to stop to take off your pack.

Wear Sleeves: Even well-fitting hiking packs can cause chafing when they rub against your skin. Wearing a shirt with sleeves is the best way to protect your shoulders and arms from unnecessary pain.

Start With Some Trial Runs: Starting small is good advice for every outdoor sport. Don’t take your hiking pack out for an epic all-day mountain run without testing it out first. A few short runs with a full pack will help you dial in the fit and identify any issues before you really get out there.

Most importantly, don’t let fear of not having the perfect gear prevent you from trying something new! The best way to start trail running is to just get out there, with whatever gear you currently have. Pathloom is here to help! Plan appropriately, find some trail running buds, and hit the trails!

Ah, nature, the famous muse of John Muir, Teddy Roosevelt, Aldo Leopold, Henry David Thoreau, and Bill Watterson. There is a ton of nature-oriented content out there for people to sink their teeth into. Sometimes, however, the reading can be a bit dense. Often, a quick movie or series is the perfect solution to re-inspire your nature side, and below, we have the best of the best. 
         The beauty, danger and ultimate superiority of nature is one of the great permanent facts of life on earth. No matter how much we aim to tame the unknown, there will always be room for nature to surprise us. Nature’s unwavering commitment to awe the human species has led to some amazing individual accomplishments. From first ascents to stories of rescue, danger and recovery in nature, our relationship with (and often fighting against) the elements can invoke a deep sense of understanding and respect.

So, when various media reminds us of the adventure and importance of nature, we’re offered a chance to remember why we don’t pave paradise and put up a parking lot. The choices below are meant to inspire and deepen your appreciation of what’s on this little blue marble floating in space.

We love our outdoor movies here at Pathloom, and have covered this topic a few times in the past, but there are so many good ones out there that we wanted to revisit and recommend a few more for your viewing pleasure.

Categories
         It is extremely helpful to break down the massive subject of nature movies into more manageable pieces. The word nature means the collective phenomena of the physical world - including animals, biomes, physical sciences, and everything in between. It’s quite a big topic to cover!
         Generally, the best outdoor movies and series about nature fall into a few broad categories: survival, adventure/renewal, animals/environment, and accomplishments. Each category sheds light on not only how the planet works but our complex relationship with it. Let’s dive in.

Movies about Survival and Tragedy

The two outdoor movies that spring out at me in this category both deal with human beings and their will to survive against all odds. 

Touching the Void

Touching the Void is a particularly searing tale of mountaineers in Peru, where glaciated mountains routinely rise over 20,000 feet in elevation as part of the impressive Andes Chain. It’s harrowing, inspiring and emotional in a way that few movies or documentaries have ever been.





The Mountain Between Us

The Mountain Between Us may be a bit less known, but I think it introduces an element missing from traditional outdoor-oriented movies: people with little to no survival experience. Movies like Touching the Void or 127 Hours (an honorable mention) have competent and ambitious outdoor folk at the center of the stories. The Mountain Between Us has two regular people forced into a survival situation. The plot is so-so, but the scenery is alive, and there’s seldom a time you don’t feel cold watching these two people try to get out of the mountains alive. I think it’s a great case study on fear, isolation, the human spirit, and ultimately how small decisions can have big impacts.


 Movies about Adventure and Renewal
 Many speak of the healing power of nature, either as an escape or an alternative to human-centric society. Nurturing that connection can be transformative in a wholly unique and profound way. Each of the movies in this category touch upon that experience.

A Walk in the Woods

A Walk in the Woods is an outdoor movie based on the book by Bill Bryson, where two aging friends decide to walk the more than 2,000-mile Appalachian Trail. It’s a thruhiking tale full of fantastic scenery, and distills the issues we all face in various aspects of life - as outdoor movies often do. 






Wild

Wild, starring Reese Witherspoon, is a similarly styled thruhiking renewal tale but with more of an urgent message. The main character is in a bad spot in life, and the wide-open spaces on the Pacific Crest Trail provide salvation for her. While the specifics of the story can be hard to relate to at times, the scenery and overall message of renewal through nature are certainly powerful storytelling components.




         Into The Wild

The last movie in this category is as strange a tale as it is fascinating. Based on the bestselling book (as many of these selections are), Into The Wild is both a tale of nature renewal and tragedy, dunked in a healthy amount of mystery. A seemingly happy man decides to go off the grid, completely change his life and live out of an abandoned school bus in the Alaskan countryside. Debated hotly to this day, both the movie and the book usually spur some fantastic and interesting conversation about freedom, choices, and the unknown.
            
Movies about Animals and the Environment

Without the natural order of things, we wouldn’t be able to survive on this planet, and yet still so little is truly known about the natural world. These two documentaries were chosen because they reinvigorated a sense of kinship between people and the natural world. 

March of the Penguins

The family-friendly March of the Penguins follows Emperor Penguins on their long yearly journey through the frozen land of Antarctica. It not only shows us an intimate portrait of a land few will ever see in person, but does so through the instantly relatable connection of family and survival. Following the release of March of the Penguins, nature documentaries following specific animal species took off, and we’re blessed with a ton of fantastic options because of the impact this movie had.



Planet Earth

As far as nature documentaries go, nothing beats Planet Earth (and its sequel Planet Earth II). This BBC-produced series redefined our understanding of the natural world through the gorgeous medium of film. Planet Earth was such a success when it was released that it inspired a renaissance of planet-focused documentaries. Without Planet Earth, we wouldn’t have the Blue Planet, Blue Planet II, Frozen Planet, Seven Worlds One Planet, and Our Planet, as well as so many others which combine riveting storytelling with amazing visual treats to create truly exceptional pieces of film.
 

Movies about Accomplishments
         Our favorite movies about outdoor accomplishments have already been discussed in past articles on the Pathloom Blog covering our favorite movies. But who doesn’t enjoy watching people accomplish the unthinkable? These three documentaries are almost required viewing for anyone interested in exploration and adventure - and are so good they bear repeating here in this list as well!

The Dawn Wall

The Dawn Wall is the oldest and perhaps least known of the three, but the actions of its central character are completely relatable, tragic and ultimately, uplifting. In fact, the accomplishments and camaraderie between Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson form the heart of the film - and remind us that while there’s a certain mysticism about conquering objectives on your own, nothing beats doing it with a friend.



         Free Solo

A friend of Caldwell’s, Alex Honnold, would go on to make a name for himself in the climbing world by free soloing El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Unlike The Dawn Wall, where the two climbers mapped and pioneered what is routinely considered one of the most difficult big wall routes in the world, Honnold took an established route (The Freerider) and climbed the entire thing without ropes or any sort of safety harness. (?!) The documentary Free Solo is a stunning portrayal of a man without fear, and features some of the best and most inspiring scenery ever captured in a documentary.

         The Alpinist

The Alpinist takes the cake in terms of extreme accomplishments. While Caldwell and Honnold are far and away two of the greatest rock climbers to try the sport, Marc Andre Leclerc takes it one step further. He climbs big, technical mountains - solo. This involves rock climbing, ice climbing, mixed climbing and all sorts of extreme environmental conditions. To follow his adventures is a jaw-dropping journey, and is worth every viewing second.



Honorable Mentions
         There are always hits and misses with any list, and this one is no exception. Some of the best honorable mentions are listed below. These nature movies and series have a lot of the same qualities as the previous selections, they each offer more chances for us to further understand the earth and our relationship with it.

·   127 Hours (survival)
·   The Way (renewal)
·   Blue Planet/Blue Planet II (environment/animals)

Whether you suffer from severe seasonal allergies or are prone to the occasional sneezing attack when you come into contact with ragweed - you certainly don’t want to sniff and snot your way through a hike or camping trip!      

An itchy nose, runny eyes, and a tight chest aren’t going to make hiking easy, and they certainly aren’t going to make spending the night outdoors a pleasant experience!
How, then, do you cope with an allergy attack or an irritation caused by environmental factors?

In this guide, we’ll help you with some tips and tricks to ensure you stay sneeze-free while enjoying the great outdoors. Whether you’re a chronic allergy sufferer or simply want to learn more about how pollen affects the body, we’re here to help you improve your knowledge of allergies from every angle and gain insight into how best to avoid them while spending time in nature. 

Just remember that if you suffer from any sort of allergies it is always best to consult with a doctor. Advice from a medical professional is the best way to mitigate symptoms and address any type of allergic reaction—seasonal or otherwise.

General Allergy Avoidance Tactics Everyone Should Know 

Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to have a chronic pollen allergy to experience an uncomfortable reaction to it. In fact, as many as 60 million people in the US report feeling itchy and sneeze-y during peak pollen season—and it’s about time we learned how to best mitigate those symptoms. 

Fortunately, there are plenty of simple ways to avoid feeling the effects of pollen and other allergens while spending time outdoors. Some of the most popular ones include:

Know your allergen triggers – Not everyone is allergic to the same type of pollen. Grass pollen, weed pollen, and tree pollen affect different people in different ways, so finding out which one(s) you are most sensitive to can help prevent reactions from occurring. An allergist can certainly help with this.

Learn about allergy seasons – In the US, there are different seasons when specific allergens are more prevalent. Generally, spring allergies start around February and can last all the way into summer. Tree pollination begins first, followed by flowers and grass. Ragweed pollination starts in the late summer and leads into the fall. There are plenty of online resources to help track down when your specific allergen hits the hardest.

Different states also have varying pollen counts, depending on the climate. The warmer it is, the longer and more intense the pollen season and as climate change progresses, the season gets longer too. Get to know a bit about the different pollen seasons and when the allergens are at their worst so that you can plan your outdoor activities around this.

Track your local pollen count – Today, we have the luxury of access to a variety of apps that forecast pollen levels in any given location. Utilize this as a tool for determining which dates are best to be out and about. If the pollen count is high, be proactive and prepare accordingly, and/or plan your excursion or camping trip for another time.

Avoid early morning activity – Pollen counts tend to be highest in the morning between 5 and 10 am. If you want to avoid unpleasant hay fever symptoms, it’s better to start your hike a bit later in the day. Just be sure to plan your route properly, as you don’t necessarily want to get caught on the trail in the dark!     

Wear a mask – Not everyone is a fan of masks  (especially after Covid!), but wearing a cotton mask or buff over your nose and mouth can help prevent pollen particles from entering your system. If pollen really affects you badly, it’s a good idea to take one along to protect your facial cavities when passing through high pollen areas. You can always take it off once you’ve moved on.

Learn which plants to avoid – Ragweed is one of the most common pollen allergens, but some others include birch, elm, tumbleweed, poplar, sagebrush, Bermuda grass, and English Plantain. Get to know what these plants look like, where they grow locally, and where they are the most prolific. Avoid them wherever possible - and whatever you do, do not touch them!

These are some of the most basic tactics for allergic reaction avoidance that everybody should be aware of. However, if you are a little more sensitive to these problematic plant particles, keep reading!

Tips For Mild Allergy Sufferers 

Those of us unlucky enough to suffer more serious reactions to pollen season need to be better equipped for avoiding unpleasant congestion, itchiness and sneezing. 
If you have a history of mild hay fever symptoms, the following tips may help you reduce them. 

Seek out natural remedies – If your allergies lie somewhere in between minor and chronic, packing snack foods that offer natural relief might be a good idea for your outdoor excursion. Honey and lemon tea, pineapple, vitamin C, garlic, onion, and other anti-inflammatory foods have all proven to be supportive in combating common hay fever symptoms. 

Look for plant-based remedies along the trail: There are a few plants that you may encounter along the way that act as natural remedies for allergies or the symptoms of allergies. Butterbur has proven to significantly improve unpleasant allergy symptoms, stinging nettles can inhibit the inflammatory events that cause allergies, and rosemary helps to fight allergy symptoms. 

Knowing what these plants look like, how to find them in the wild, and how to properly utilize them can help you out when you’re in a fix. However, you must be 100% certain that you know exactly what these plants look like and how to use them. If not, you could make a bad situation worse! Making a mistake like eating stinging nettles because you think they can stop your nose running sounds particularly unpleasant… Do your homework first!

Have a plan of action – Don’t go wandering into the pollen-high wilderness unprepared. Know what your triggers are and make sure you bring along any medication, masks, tinctures, or tools to help you recover in the event of a bad reaction. 

Drink lots of water – Allergies or not, drinking water while hiking or camping is always recommended for preventing dehydration. But drinking lots of water also has other benefits— it soothes allergic reactions and helps to reduce nasal dryness. Fill up that bottle!

Of course, if you notice your reactions growing worse over time, talk to your doctor to find out if there’s an allergy medication that will help to soothe your symptoms. 



Tips For Chronic Allergy Sufferers 

The symptoms of a chronic pollen allergy can include severe congestion, watery, itchy eyes, itchy and inflamed sinuses, postnasal drip, dry cough, compulsive sneezing, and difficulty breathing. Overall, none of these are particularly conducive to a hike or camping trip! Here are some quick tips for all the chronic allergy sufferers who love the great outdoors: 

Always pack your medicine – Antihistamines are one of the most effective medications you can use against a pollen allergy. For the best results, take them before leaving the house, and then as many times as your doctor recommends throughout your outdoor trip. Pack plenty. 

Plan your route meticulously – The more you know about the area you will be exploring, the easier it will be to avoid allergens, and prepare for allergic reactions when you do encounter them. 

Bring a moisturizer – A soothing chapstick or moisturizer for your lips and nose can bring relief after a round of sneezing. Keep applying to avoid dryness and itchiness.

Use a saline solution – A saline solution is a mixture of purified water and iodized salt. By squirting some up your nostrils with a tincture bottle (or neti pot), you can flush out pollen particles and soothe inflammation. 

Clean out your tent/equipment beforehand – If you’re camping, make sure your tent is free from any dust or pollen left over from your previous trip. Always wash your sleeping bag and any other items that you come into close contact with. Air dry them and ensure they get a good shake out too. 

The last thing you want is to be coughing, sneezing, and wheezing through a beautiful outdoor adventure. Make sure you prepare for allergic reactions well in advance and have everything you need to enjoy a comfortable outdoor experience.

Summary 

All in all, there are many ways to avoid the worst parts of pollen allergy season. With some trusty antihistamines, pollen-tracking apps, saline solutions and more, a large number of people can reduce their symptoms of hay fever in an accessible, effective way. 
As we mentioned before, the only way to truly determine the severity of your pollen allergy is to consult with a professional. Visit a doctor to run tests to find out what level of threat you’re facing, and what precautions you should be taking. With a little bit of advance preparation, you can ensure your allergies won’t prevent you from getting outdoors as often as possible!

Ultralight Backpacking Essentials Worth The Money
Get The Most Bang For Your Buck With The Least Weight On Your Back

It is a backpacking rite of passage to suffer under the weight of an unnecessarily heavy pack. Most of us make our first backcountry voyage with clunky rentals or reappropriated car camping gear, and pack way, way more than we really need. 

I look back in awe at what accompanied me on my first backpacking trip years ago. From multiple extra shirts, to cans of beer, to a paperback novel - packed naively assuming I’d have the energy to read in my sleeping bag at the end of the day (I most certainly did not!)

I quickly identified the items not worth the pain. A light pack means a happy back, and thus a backpacking experience that is far more enjoyable. But learning what not to bring only gets you so far, the essential gear that you do bring with you needs to get lighter as well.

Unfortunately, when it comes to backpacking gear, ultralight almost always means ultra-expensive. But some key pieces of gear are worth the upfront investment.

How to Get Started with Ultralight Backpacking Gear

Rather than spending thousands of dollars overhauling your entire kit to make all of your backpacking gear ultralight, it is better to go one step at a time, beginning with the items that make the biggest difference.

Your tent, backpack, and sleep system (sleeping bag and pad), known as “The Big Three”, are the heaviest pieces of gear in any backpacking setup. Upgrading these is the best way to save a ton of weight. Since ultralight setups are not particularly well suited to the rigors of winter backpacking, we will focus this guide on the best three-season gear.

Ultralight Tents

Ultralight backpackers aspire to get each of their Big Three items to under 3 pounds apiece. Many conventional three-season backpacking tents weigh more than double that. Depending on your current tent, replacing it with an ultralight alternative could reduce your overall pack weight by 10-15%.

Designing a tent that clocks in under 3 pounds demands some creative design and material choices. Manufacturers often feature minimal zippers and storage pockets, are made of lightweight (AKA expensive) fabrics such as Dyneema, and even utilize trekking poles as tent poles to help save weight.

The best ultralight tents come from specialty manufacturers like Tarptent and Durston Gear. But with small production runs and generally limited retail presence, these tents often sell out quickly and/or have significant order lead times. 

Fortunately, some larger brands are adding ultralight tents to their product lines. Two excellent tents that you may have more luck finding at your local outdoor shop include the Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL 2 and the NEMO Hornet 2.

Ultralight Sleep Systems

To achieve a sub-3 pound sleep system, look for a sleeping bag weighing 2 pounds or less, and a sleeping pad weighing 1 pound or less.

For a three-season backpacking sleeping bag, you want to look for a temperature rating suitable for as low as 20 degrees F. High-quality down bags or quilts provide more loft and warmth at lighter weights than synthetic bags. Down does lose its insulating abilities when wet, but if you are mindful of conditions and are careful to keep it dry, it is the best way to go ultralight without freezing. Down is also very compressible, allowing you to get away with a lighter, lower-volume backpack. 

This often means spending upward of $400, but a good down bag can last 10 years or more with proper care. Feathered Friends, Western Mountaineering, and Zpacks are among the best ultralight sleeping bag and quilt manufacturers. These brands offer exceptional build quality using down that is certified by the Responsible Down Standard, ensuring it is sourced ethically and sustainably.

Air-inflated sleeping pads are the best choice for an ultralight pad. The best ones, like the Sea to Summit XT Insulated Pad, can be extremely comfortable even while weighing just over 1 pound.

Ultralight Backpacks

After upgrading your tent and sleep system, the next big ticket item is your backpack itself. Plan for it to be the last of your Big Three purchases. Knowing the volume of your tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping pad in advance will allow you to pick a backpack of the appropriate size and design.

For most three-season trips, from a simple two-night getaway to a Pacific Crest Trail thruhike, a 50-60 liter pack is the sweet spot, offering a good balance between capability and weight.

It is now easy to find backpacks from well-known brands like Osprey and Gregory in the low 2-pound range. Specialty manufacturers to consider include Hyperlite Mountain Gear and Gossamer Gear. Just make sure whatever pack you choose can accommodate the rest of your gear as well!

Ultralight Gear Beyond the Big Three

By upgrading your Big Three, the most important work is done. Though you can continue down the ultralight rabbit hole forever, keep in mind that the real joy of backpacking comes from exploring beautiful places with people we love. The gear is merely a means to support that end.

Ultralight shouldn’t distract you from what really matters. Rather, it should help you prioritize the important stuff. Ultralight means hiking more often and for longer, with less discomfort. It means you can now afford to bring that book, that beer to chill in a glacial mountain creek, or anything that makes your trip more memorable. Think of ultralight as adding value, not just subtracting weight. And by investing in expensive gear that will hold up for years versus constantly needing to replace the cheap stuff, you may even save money in the long run!

Of course, you can obsess about your spork choice, ditch stoves for cold-soaked meals, and trim off your toothbrush handle, all to shed a few ounces. Many do this and derive a lot of satisfaction from a perfectly tuned kit that is light as a feather. However, the value added begins to diminish rather quickly the further down this ultralight rabbit hole you go.

But if you do indeed wish to continue refining your ultralight backpacking setup, here are the weightier categories beyond the Big Three worthy of ultralight upgrades, and our pick for the best product for each:

Best Ultralight Stove: Snow Peak LiteMax Stove 
Best Ultralight Filtration System: Sawyer Squeeze Water Filter
Best Ultralight Cookware: SOTO Thermostack Combo

Go Ultralight, Not Stupid Light

If you begin compromising your ability to stay safe or comfortable in the backcountry all in service to the Almighty Ounce, you’ve gone too far. You have transcended ultralight and are now in the realm of stupid light. 

In practice, stupid light can look like:
Being unprepared for extreme weather by forgoing rain pants or “bulky” fleece mid-layers
Trying to save weight by choosing a sleep system without adequate insulation
Not bringing bug protection when bugs are expected
Not bringing a bear canister or bear spray to bear country

If your ability to survive worst case scenarios is compromised, or you have sacrificed any semblance of comfort, your gear is not ultralight - it is simply inappropriate for the conditions. 

Lighter is better... until it isn’t. Ultimately, bringing gear you don’t end up needing is preferable to needing gear you don’t have.

A headlamp is an essential item that everyone should own - whether you’re an enthusiastic and experienced traveler, or someone who just likes to go camping or hiking once in a while.

A headlamp is the best way to illuminate an area when it's dark, while keeping your hands free for other applications. That's why it is ideal to bring one when going hiking, camping, and on similar adventures - no need to be constantly holding a flashlight once the sun goes down.

Choosing a suitable headlamp for your adventures can be somewhat of a challenge. The market is flooded with so many products that you’ll need to know which features to give precedence to, depending on your adventures of choice.

Here we highlight some of the most important features to look for when shopping for a headlamp, as well as our recommendations for the top 5 headlamps for backpacking. This simple guide will help you find the best headlamp for your next adventure.

Factors To Consider When Buying A Headlamp

Buying a high-quality headlamp with the right features for your needs is no easy feat. You need to do a lot of research and read as many reviews as possible to find out which one suits you best.

Here are some of the main features you need to look for in a headlamp.


Water-Resistance (IP Rating)

Water resistance and IP ratings are vital when choosing a headlamp for your outdoor activities or adventures.

You never know when the weather might turn against you when out in the wilderness, so always be prepared with a headlamp you can use even in bad weather conditions. You don’t want your only source of light to short out if it starts raining during your hike!

Headlamps, like many electronic devices, have their ability to resist water and other sources of damage graded on the IPX scale. The low end of the IPX rating, IP0, means the headlamp is no water resistance at all. IPX8 is at the higher end, which means that the headlamp will work fine in inclement weather, or even for up to 30 minutes when submerged underwater!

A minimum of IPX4 should be sufficient to handle most rain and snow conditions.


Light Output

The light output is another essential feature of any headlamp. It's what people tend to look for first when buying a headlamp for outdoor activities.

Camping, hiking, and many other outdoor activities involve moving along in the darkness, which means that you need to have a very bright light when heading out into the wilderness.

Many headlamps can adjust the brightness by setting the lumens output, ranging from 100 up to 1000 lumens.

A headlamp with a lumens output between 100 and 300 should be enough for basic outdoor activities, including camping, hiking, and backpacking.


Beam Distance

The beam distance is also as crucial as the lumens output - you need to ensure your surrounding area will be sufficiently lit up by the brightness of your headlamp, especially while out hiking, camping, or backpacking.

There is no point in having a bright headlamp if it doesn't brighten up a large enough area for you to see the path ahead!

Some headlamps offer a feature that switches between a concentrated beam designed to illuminate the trail ahead, versus a wider beam that spreads light out which might be better for outdoor applications such as camping and hiking.

Typically, a beam distance of about 360 feet is ideal for hikers, campers, and backpackers.


Weight

Weight is also a crucial factor in a headlamp. Hikers, campers, and backpackers usually carry many things on their backs. They want to take only the essentials, as well as any emergency items with them on their adventures.

Since they already have a load on their backs, they are constantly looking for ways to pack lighter to facilitate their movement.The last thing a hiker or backpacker wants is a bulky headlamp taking up room in their pack, let alone fixed on their forehead! 

The ideal headlamp weight for a backpacker or hiker ranges between 2 and 4 oz. The lighter, the better because you won't feel its weight on your forehead.


Battery

Going on an outdoor adventure means you will be out without essential facilities - such as a steady supply of electricity!

Therefore, you need to consider your headlamp battery options carefully. Going for a headlamp with both rechargeable and AAA battery insertion options is best. That way, you can switch to using disposable batteries in the event your headlamp runs out of charge.

Always remember to keep extra batteries on hand so you can use them with your headlamp whenever required!


Ability To Switch To Low-Light Red Coloring

Headlamps often come equipped with different types of light modes that suit various situations. These light modes include strobe, red light, high (spotlight), and low (floodlight).

When using a headlamp for outdoor activities like hiking, camping, and backpacking, it's a good idea to look for one that can switch to low-light red coloring.

Red light uses very little battery, preserves your night vision, and doesn't cause your pupils to dilate at night. Therefore, it's best to switch on the low-light red coloring late at night at your campsite, or whenever your headlamp runs low on power.

Red light also doesn't tend to attract as many insects as white lights do.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park is an American treasure, but certainly not a hidden one. Over 14 million people visited the park in 2021, making it far and away the most popular National Park in the country. 

Many people limit their visits to scenic auto tours on the park’s 384 miles of road, hardly scratching its surface. However - with 800 square miles of old growth forests, towering waterfalls, ancient mountains, and endless hiking trails - camping in Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the best way to truly experience this special place in all its glory.

Camping in Great Smoky Mountains National Park

Camping options are relatively plentiful in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. There are ten campgrounds within park boundaries. Eight either require or accept reservations and two are entirely first-come, first-served. All but one (Big Creek Campground) can accommodate RVs. 

The park also features some of the most scenic, plentiful, and wild backcountry camping opportunities on the east side of the Mississippi. There are over 100 backcountry sites throughout the Smokies, including 12 Appalachian Trail shelters along its 71-mile stretch through the park. Keep in mind that you’ll need a permit for any overnight trip in the park’s backcountry.

You can explore the National Park Service website for descriptions and details for all of the campgrounds in the Smokies. But this can be a bit overwhelming - to make planning your trip nice and easy, we have handpicked our personal favorites for every type of camping preference.

Developed Campgrounds

From solitude seekers to gregarious groups, let’s start with the best developed campgrounds in the Great Smoky Mountains.


Best for Nature Lovers: Cosby Campground

Nestled in a forested, shaded valley of the northeast corner of the Smokies, Cosby Campground provides some respite from the busier parts of the park. With access to the Appalachian Trail and dozens of other routes, it is the best camping option for nature lovers looking to get out and explore the wonders of the Park.

There are 157 campsites at Cosby, though only a handful can accommodate RVs. Reservations are accepted, and the campground is open from mid-May to late October every year.


Best for RVs and Larger Groups: Cades Cove Campground

Located in one of the most popular regions of the park, Cades Cove Campground is an excellent home base for both RV campers and large groups. It has 159 individual campsites, plus four group sites that can host up to 30 people. 

Group camping is tent-only, but most of the other sites can accommodate RVs. Cades Cove has a campground store, an RV dump station, and is located within close proximity to countless activities. Every member of your group will have something to do, from touring the nearby historic log structures, taking a horseback or carriage ride, or exploring miles of hiking and biking trails. 

This campground is open year-round, and sites are available for reservation on a six-month rolling basis. 


Best for Last-Minute Planners: Deep Creek Campground

For the impulsive among us, do not fret - you can still pull off that last-minute camping trip in the Smokies! Your best bet is to head for Deep Creek Campground, where the 92 campsites are all first-come, first-served - and each one can accommodate both RVs and tents.

The campground is surrounded by picturesque streams and waterfalls, and is located near some of the best hiking trails in the entire park - such as the Deep Creek Loop Trail and the Lonesome Pine Overlook. It is open from mid-April to late October.


Best for Things to Do: Elkmont Campground

Elkmont Campground is the largest, busiest, and most accessible campground in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Just 8 miles from the bustling tourist town of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Elkmont offers quick access to museums, restaurants, galleries, and aquariums — all while getting to camp in the captivating old growth forests of the National Park. 

The campground features 200 tent/RV campsites and 20 walk-in tent sites, and is open from mid-March to late October. Reservations are accepted and can be made up to six months in advance.


Best For Privacy: Balsam Mountain Campground

Privacy can still be found, even at America’s busiest National Park. For some seclusion away from the typical tourist destinations, we recommend Balsam Mountain Campground. There are 46 quiet, secluded, unserviced tent/RV campsites.

The Balsam Mountain region, on the North Carolina side of the park’s southern reaches, is a hiking and fishing paradise - with only a fraction of the traffic that popular spots like Cades Cove and the Sugarlands receive. Reservations are required to stay at this campground, which is open from mid-May to early October.

Backcountry Camping

Opportunities for backcountry camping in Great Smoky Mountains National Park are bountiful. Over 100 designated dispersed campsites and shelters provide a lifetime’s worth of backpacking adventures, with itineraries for every skill level from absolute beginners to the most experienced hikers. 

Most of the 100+ campsites are identified by a number rather than a name. You can review the park’s detailed campground and trail map for trip inspiration.

Backcountry reservations are required and cost $4 per person per night, up to a maximum fee of $20 - even for trips longer than five nights. All shelters, as well as campsite #113, have a maximum one-night stay. All other campsites have a maximum three-night stay, after which you can stay in the backcountry, but will need to move on to another site. Reservations can be made online or in person through the Backcountry Office at the Sugarlands Visitor Center.

Whether as one-night destinations or as part of a longer trip, here are a few of our can’t-miss campsites and trails within the Great Smoky Mountain backcountry:

Campsite No. 13 (Gregory Bald Trail): Famous for panoramic views and vibrant summer blooms of flame azaleas, Gregory Bald is one of the highlights of the entire National Park. Catch an epic sunset and stay at Campsite No.13 to turn this 11.3 mile trip along Gregory Bald Trail into an unforgettable overnight adventure.
Campsite No. 32 (Grapeyard Ridge Trail): Camping at Campsite No. 32 is great for solitude seekers and history buffs. The Grapeyard Ridge Trail weaves past ancient homesteads and pioneer cemeteries, deep within the beautiful and rarely visited creeks and ravines of the Smokies backcountry.
Campsite No. 50 (Chasteen Creek Cascade Trail): This creekside campsite is one of the most beautiful — and accessible — camping spots in the Park’s backcountry. Close to the stunning Chasteen Creek Cascades and only a mile from the Bradley Fork Trailhead, Campsite No. 50 is perfect for first time backpackers or families.

Camping Outside Park Boundaries

The immense popularity of Great Smoky Mountains National Park means that there is no shortage of camping options just outside the park as well. From primitive sites to full-service RV campgrounds to yurts and luxury cabins, there are far more options than we can cover here. The areas around Gatlinburg, Townsend, and Cherokee in particular all have several campground options, and offer quick access to the National Park.

For the adventurous, frugal, or crowd-averse, free camping in the National Forests surrounding the Smokies is another excellent option. Cherokee National Forest, Nantahala National Forest, and Pisgah National Forest all offer plentiful primitive or dispersed camping opportunities, and are a way to experience some iconic Smokies scenery while staying off the beaten path.

Planning Your Great Smoky Mountains Camping Trip

With so many camping options, and so many differences in reservation systems, amenities, and accessibility, trip planning quickly becomes arduous. Camping should be stress-relieving, not stress-inducing. Rather than being a logistical exercise, it should be a time to focus on what really matters and what we love to do.

Our goal at Pathloom is to make that happen: explore our outdoor trip planning app to find out how we’re making outdoor adventure easier and more enjoyable for all!

Hiking solo has a unique appeal, but sometimes we crave a little company. Sharing the challenge of a hike with another person will affect the entire experience. Whether this change is positive or negative rests heavily on the partner.

The good news is that trails are more populated than ever after the massive boom in 2020. Thanks to that, there's an abundant crop of both new and experienced trekkers to pick from for a competent hiking buddy. All that's left is knowing what to look for, and where to find them.

How to Find Hiking or Backpacking Buddies


Academics congregate in places like museums or debates. Avid readers choose bookstores or libraries. Like all hobbies, finding fellow enthusiasts is about putting yourself in the right places.


Start by Asking Friends and Family

This tip sounds obvious, but many people tend to skip right over it. New hobbies have us learning new things and visiting new places. The novelty can trick people into believing they also need new people to do it with, rather than asking their already existing social circles.

It's best not to assume what people are and aren't interested in, even if that person is a member of your family or a long-time friend. Perhaps they'll be more interested than you thought they’d be.


Join a Hiking or Backpacking Club

If friends and family are a bust, the next best option is to find a hiking or backpacking club. Clubs are great places to meet like-minded people and share information about gear and routes.

Repeatedly meeting with the same people also raises the odds of getting comfortable and forming stronger relationships. These groups can be found online, on sites such as Meetup.com or OutsideOnline, or joined through a local outdoor shop, like Cabela’s and REI.


Join a Guided Hiking or Backpacking Trip

While clubs make for good company, their events tend to be designed for larger groups. Those looking for a more personal experience with their hiking partners should join a guided hike instead. Rather than trying to integrate with an entire group, one-time excursions provide chances to socialize and bond with an individual.

Join Events at Local Parks

Local parks and nature centers offer recreational activities for all ages, including hikes and workshops. You may even find a group who wants to explore the natural beauty around them.

Signing up for the newsletters many of these parks distribute is an ideal way to stay current on their upcoming events. Most newsletter subscriptions now have ways to filter what kind of information you receive. Customizing the subscription will help avoid uninteresting spam news.


Volunteer at a Nearby Natural Area

Meeting people through volunteering in natural areas ensures everyone shares a similar passion for nature. Otherwise, they wouldn't be giving away their time for free!

Not only is this a way to keep the hiking community strong, but it's also a chance to grow your knowledge. Consider tasks like trail maintenance, which can train the eye to recognize hazards and discover new routes. You can also consider cleaning up debris to help people learn about the impact trash has on the environment, or guiding people through local nature preserves to help them learn about the history of your community. 

Common volunteer opportunities include:
Campground hosting
Trail cleanup
Visitor and guide services
Outdoor Event planning

You can find local events and opportunities via organizations such as the Bureau of Land Management, State and National Park programs, The Nature Conservancy, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife. Each of these programs welcomes volunteers, so if you have the time, you can help several!


Find a Social Media Group

Many communities and clubs use Facebook groups to organize events and meetups. Social media is an easy place to create massive networks on any topic. Each online hiking community has hundreds or even thousands of members posting regularly about events, so there's always something coming up. Forum boards such as BackCountryGear and BackpackingLight are also great options for anyone not on social media who wants to find some company for the trail.

How to Choose a Hiking or Backpacking Buddy


The right hiking partner should share your passion for the outdoors, but that's just the starting point. Hiking is a versatile experience, and people enjoy different aspects of it. 

If one partner enjoys the more physical parts of hiking, then they won't appreciate their partner stopping every 10 minutes to take in a beautiful view. The same goes when one hiker prefers silence and the sounds of nature, while the other prefers to chat during the walk. 

Like in every relationship, compatibility is important to ensure that you and your hiking partner are on the same page.


Learn More About Your New Partner

However, even before compatibility, safety is the highest priority. Long trails take us to new and often secluded areas. Being on a hike with a shady person sounds like the backdrop for a slasher film.

A phone lookup is one way to gather information on a person solely through their phone number. It searches through public records to find personal information such as employment, address, and full name. While phone lookups aren't 100 percent accurate, they're effective at determining if someone is lying about their identity. You can also run a quick scan of a person’s social media posts to ensure they align with your beliefs and stances on the environment.

Choose Someone Fit Enough for Your Goals

The physical requirements of hiking range across a massive spectrum. There are relaxing half-hour hikes and there are multi-day treks. The hike won't be as enjoyable if one partner can't complete it, or even keep pace with the other.

Now, it's possible to work up to those loftier goals together. However, that scenario requires that both partners have the same end goal in mind, and one isn't forcing the other to overexert themselves.


Start with a Trial Hike

A trial hike is a short test to see if two people's goals, personalities, and values align. Try going on a short hike together, in a similar environment to what you plan on doing during your extended expeditions. 

Try to choose a location identical in terrain to where you’d eventually end up wanting to take your new partner. There's no point if the trial hike is on a paved road while the actual hikes include long stints of bouldering. 

Create reasonable expectations for how you plan to interact with your partner in the future.

Conclusion

Depending on your preferences, there are many ways to find a hiking or backpacking buddy. Social media and organized events are great places to build relationships with fellow hikers - but if you are a newbie, you should try to find a skilled professional to take you through your initial hiking experiences. Over time, you'll learn what you like and dislike in a partner. 

While it's hard to find a perfect fit right away, the most important thing is to get yourself out there instead of waiting for somebody else to find you!

Buyer's Guide to Sleeping Bags for Camping and Backpacking
How to Pick the Right Sleeping Bag for Your Style of Camping

Buying a new sleeping bag for camping adventures is no small decision; in fact, your sleeping bag can very well make or break your entire camping experience. Few things are worse than shivering through the night because your gear wasn’t up to the task.

Don’t sacrifice camping coziness on your next trip by being unprepared: here is everything you need to know when deciding on the best sleeping bag for you. 

Sleeping Bags for Camping vs. Backpacking

Knowing whether you will be camping in close proximity to your car or carrying your gear on your back for miles is the first factor to consider when picking a sleeping bag.

Backpacking sleeping bags are made to be lightweight and packable, which requires pricier materials and slimmer designs. Sleeping bags for car camping are not subject to the same limitations, so they tend to be more spacious and affordable than backpacking-specific bags.

However, if you plan to take your bag both backpacking and car camping, it makes sense to spend a little more and invest in a dedicated backpacking sleeping bag, allowing you to do it all with a single bag.

Sleeping Bag Temperature Ratings

There is more to sleeping bag temperature ratings than you might think. In the past, brands created their own ratings based on internal testing methods and standards, and they were notoriously inconsistent and unreliable. It made comparing sleeping bags from different brands nearly impossible.

Fortunately, most manufacturers now adhere to the European Norm International Standardization Organization (EN/ISO) testing standard. Sleeping bag tests are conducted by a certified third party, offering a more reliable and standardized indicator of temperature ranges across brands. This standard assigns three ratings to every sleeping bag:

EN/ISO Comfort Range: The lowest temperature at which the average woman will sleep comfortably with the sleeping bag.
EN/ISO Transition Range: The temperature at which the average man will begin feeling cold, but not shivering. This is considered the performance limit of the sleeping bag.
EN/ISO Extreme Range: The temperature where a sleeping bag may help you stay alive in an emergency, but it will be far from comfortable: you will experience extreme cold and risk hypothermia.

Sleeping bags typically fit into one of three categories based on their comfort range rating:

Summer Sleeping Bags: +30 F and higher
3-Season Sleeping Bags: +15 F to +30 F
Winter Sleeping Bags: +15 F and lower

Depending on the location of the manufacturer, ratings may be presented in either Celsius or Fahrenheit, so always double check the temperature scale before buying a new bag!

Since the “average sleeper” is an abstraction, always take sleeping bag temperature ratings with a grain of salt. A comfort rating of 15 F does not mean you will be comfortable at 15 F. Seasons are also not always an accurate way to define a sleeping bag’s potential—summer in the Colorado Rockies can be very different from summer on the Oregon Coast. At higher altitudes, 3-season bags are the way to go, even if you only camp during the summer months.

Wherever you camp, whenever you camp, be conservative and go for a sleeping bag with a comfort temperature range lower than you will likely need. Bags can always be unzipped if you’re overheating, and being too hot is certainly preferable to cold, sleepless nights in your tent because you put too much faith in your sleeping bag’s temperature rating for your individual comfort level.

Picking Your Sleeping Bag Shape and Style

Whether you run cold or hot, sleep on your side or back, prefer to be cocooned in cozy down or have space to stretch out, there are a few sleeping bag shapes and styles to consider:

Rectangular: A popular design in sleeping bags for car camping, a rectangular bag provides plenty of room to stretch out your arms and legs. They can also be fully unzipped and used as a blanket.
Barrel: Also classified as “semi-rectangular”, barrel sleeping bags taper toward the feet and often feature a hood. They are lighter than rectangular sleeping bags, striking a balance between space and coziness. 
Mummy: Most backpacking sleeping bags come in a mummy style. They are very warm but tend to be very snug—you won’t have much room to roll over or stretch out while inside.
Quilt: Backpackers looking to shed as much pack weight as possible sometimes opt for quilts—insulated blankets that secure to a sleeping pad. Unlike sleeping bags, quilts provide no insulated materials underneath you and use straps or buckles to secure to the underside of your sleeping pad. With no zippers and fewer materials these quilts are ultralight, but offer less protection from drafty conditions or extreme cold. They work best for 3-season use.
Double: Great for couples and far less constraining than typical sleeping bags, double bags are the snuggle-friendly way to camp in comfort.

Most sleeping bags come in different lengths. Choose one that is about two or three inches longer than you are tall. Any shorter, and you will press up against the head and toe box. Any longer creates unused space that fills with cold air, making the sleeping bag less insulating and efficient.

Synthetic vs. Down Insulation

The last big decision to make when buying a sleeping bag for camping is whether you want down or synthetic insulation.

Down—sourced from goose or duck feathers—is lightweight, compressible, and durable. Unfortunately, down loses much of its insulating potential when wet, so it is not the best choice for extended trips where wet and/or humid conditions are expected. The down industry is also mired in serious animal welfare issues. Prioritize buying ethical down by getting a sleeping bag featuring RDS (Responsible Down Standard) or TDS (Global Traceable Down Standard) labels.

Synthetic down is made from polyester spun into filaments. Sleeping bags with synthetic insulation are less packable and durable than down bags. Down has better fill power, so more synthetic material is required to achieve equivalent loft and heat-trapping capabilities. The loft of synthetic filaments degrades with compression, so synthetic bags generally have a shorter life span than down bags. However, synthetics are cheaper and perform better than down in wet conditions.

Deciding on Your Sleeping Bag for Camping

Committing to outdoor gear is a big deal, and it can get expensive quickly. Though we would all love to have a top-of-the-line, ultralight, ultra-warm, and ultra-comfortable sleeping bag, for most of us this isn't realistic, and usually not necessary. 

To gauge how much you really need to invest in a sleeping bag for camping, consider these questions:

How many times a year will you go camping?
Will you only be car camping? If so, maybe an expensive, highly insulated, lightweight sleeping bag is excessive. You can save money by packing extra blankets in the trunk for chillier nights.
What sort of lifespan do you expect from a sleeping bag? Spending more for a high-quality, durable sleeping bag makes sense if you plan to use it often for many years.
Can you rent or buy second-hand? If you are testing the camping waters for the first time, keep your financial commitment low. Many outdoor stores rent sleeping bags and other camping gear, or you can buy second-hand from consignment shops or online gear marketplaces.

Your sleeping bag doesn’t have to be fancy or expensive, as long as it keeps you safe, warm, and comfortable. What really matters is getting outside as much as possible, with the resources available to you now.

Getting people outside as much as possible is our goal at Pathloom. We are dedicated to making outdoor adventures easy to access—for everyone. Explore our outdoor trip planning app to find even more ways to make your next camping trip even better!

It is hard to talk about the Grand Canyon without resorting to cliches. Despite the best attempts to wax poetic about how epic, awe-inspiring, powerful, and yeah, pretty darn grand it is, language simply fails to do justice to this geographical wonder. Ultimately, you have to experience it for yourself, and camping in Grand Canyon National Park is the best way to do so. We’re here to help you do it right!

Camping in Grand Canyon National Park

With five to six million people visiting every year, successfully camping in Grand Canyon National Park requires some advance planning — don’t think you can show up mid summer with no reservations and expect things to work out!

Whether you are coming with your trailer, campervan, or backcountry kit, we’ve rounded up the details on all of the best camping options available in the park to help you plan an unforgettable Grand Canyon adventure.

Developed Campgrounds

The Grand Canyon is split into two distinct sections: the South Rim and the North Rim. On opposite sides of the mile deep and 18 mile wide canyon, the two rims are separated by a five hour drive around the perimeter.

Nearly 90% of all park visitors head to the South Rim, thanks to railway services in Grand Canyon Village and its proximity to Flagstaff and Phoenix. There are more camping options here - but this means more campers as well. Campgrounds are typically fully booked at least six months in advance of the busy season (May-October).

The remote North Rim offers solitude, but fewer developed camping options. There is only one campground on this side of the National Park.

South Rim Campgrounds

The South Rim features three campgrounds within Grand Canyon National Park boundaries:

Mather Campground
Total Sites: 327
Tent Only: 55
RV Only: 0
RV Hookups: No

Located in Grand Canyon Village, Mather Campground offers the best access to the South Rim’s shops, restaurants, and tour guides. During the busy season, from March 1 to November 30, all but 10 of the 327 sites at Mather are available by reservation only. 

The campground is open throughout the winter as well, but the campground office is closed and sites are unreservable. Campers can self-register at the kiosk on a first-come, first-served basis.

Trailer Village RV Park
Total Sites: 123
Tent Only: 0
RV Only: 123
RV Hookups: Yes (80 sites)

Trailer Village RV Park is the only campground with full RV services (electrical, sewage, and water) within park boundaries. It is only 1 mile away from the South Rim trails and Visitor Center, and is also serviced by the park shuttle.

Trailer Village is open year-round, and reservations can be made up to 13 months in advance. Sites are typically fully booked a year out for the busy season.

Desert View Campground
Total Sites: 49
Tent Only: 0
RV Only: 0
RV Hookups: No

Is Grand Canyon Village too bustling and touristy for your taste? Then consider Desert View Campground, 25 miles away near the park’s serene east entrance. All 49 sites can accommodate tents, RVs, and small trailers, but there are no hookups or dump stations.

Desert View is open from mid-April to mid-October. Reservations are required, and can be made up to six months in advance.

North Rim Campgrounds

The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is tucked into the northwest corner of Arizona. You have to drive through vast, sparsely populated swaths of Nevada and Utah desert to get there. The reward is what could be considered a more “authentic” park experience - with only a fraction of the traffic and less of the tourist kitsch that fills Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim. 

North Rim Campground
Total Sites: 87
Tent Only: 12
RV Only: 0
RV Hookups: No

Developed camping in this section of the park is limited to the North Rim Campground. Most sites can accommodate either tents or RVs, but there are no RV services. The campground features a general store and a hiking trail that leads to the North Rim Visitor Center and Bright Angel Point.

The campground is open from May 15 to October 15 every year. Reservations are required and can be made six months in advance.

Backcountry Campgrounds

Camping in Grand Canyon National Park’s backcountry, a full mile down from the busy rims, is a coveted experience. Permits are required for any overnight trip in the canyon.

Permits are granted via a lottery system, with a limited number of permits available for each month and each area of the National Park. More information on Grand Canyon backcountry permits, including dates to apply for the lottery, can be found here.

Most backpackers stay at the three established backcountry campgrounds within the park’s “Corridor Zone”—Indian Garden, Bright Angel, and Cottonwood. Hikers can stay a maximum of two nights, consecutively or non-consecutively, at any of these three campgrounds.

This zone includes the most popular, well-maintained trails in the canyon, and is recommended for hikers new to the park. All three campgrounds feature picnic tables, pit toilets, and food storage lockers.

Other areas of the Grand Canyon are classified into one of three zones:

Threshold Zone: Non-maintained trails, scarce water, and less-maintained campgrounds that only have pit toilets. Camping here is recommended only for experienced backcountry travelers.
Primitive Zone: Trailheads accessible only by four wheel drive vehicles. Park infrastructure is nearly non-existent in Primitive Zones, and trails are generally not maintained. Exploring these areas is only recommended for very experienced Grand Canyon hikers with advanced route-finding skills.
Wild Zone: Trails are indistinct or nonexistent, and water sources are extremely scarce. Exploring Wild Zone areas should only be considered by expert backcountry travelers with deep experience hiking in the Grand Canyon specifically.

Finally, there is the highlight of Grand Canyon backcountry accommodations: Phantom Lodge. These historic cabins, nestled alongside the Colorado River, are a 5+ hour hike from either rim. Definitely more “glamping” than camping, staying at Phantom Ranch lets you experience the Grand Canyon backcountry in comfort. But again, you need to get lucky to stay here — reservations are based on a lottery system, and you have to enter the lottery 15 months ahead of your intended stay.

Camping on Havasupai Lands

The Havasupai Indian Reservation lies just beyond the western border of Grand Canyon National Park, featuring stunning turquoise waterfalls and gorgeous canyon hikes. The Havasupai Tribe hosts thousands of campers and hikers every year. 

The Tribal Council has suspended all tourism since 2020 due to COVID-19, but campground reservations are expected to once again be available in 2023.

Reservations are required for everyone hiking or camping on Havasupai lands, and can be made through the Tribe’s reservation system.

Planning Your Grand Canyon Camping Trip

Navigating permits, reservations, and lotteries is now the norm for our country’s busiest parks. This can make trip planning challenging and frustrating. Our goal at Pathloom is to change that, making outdoor adventures accessible and stress-free to plan—for everyone.

Worsening climate conditions are detrimental not only to the environment but to the general population of our planet as well. Research from the University of California - Davis found that climate issues damage the economy in ways that are potentially permanent and cumulative, with social consequences that adversely affect human welfare. Such broad-ranging consequences demand urgent action to mitigate the ill effects of the climate crisis. One of the best ways to do this is by making informed decisions when we engage with nature.

When we immerse ourselves in the environment, we have the capacity to make positive changes to it — in other words, we can work to leave these places better than when we found them. Fortunately, with the rise of social media, environmental awareness is being spread in a more action-driven and digestible manner. Here’s why that’s important and how it’s being done.

Why Social Media is Critical to Environmental Advocacy
Signs from climate crisis reports seem to point to human activity as only being destructive to nature. But our participation can also be beneficial to the environment — and it can inspire us to do more. A New York Times article reports that the changes in environment, when lockdowns began in 2020, made evident what impact humans had in the natural world. Although some aspects saw positive changes — record low global carbon emissions and wildlife reoccupying spaces they had previously kept away from — this improvement was not universal.

One crucial change was in how many governments, especially in developing countries, found themselves unable to pay for conservation and enforcement commonly funded by tourist activities. In response, global grassroots movements WWF and Wild Welfare sought to draw attention to environmental and animal welfare in their annual campaigns. Leveraging social media, these organizations asked participants to spread information and resources on what they can do to heighten accessibility and create positive change.

With how deeply our activities have tied us to the natural world, removing ourselves from the equation abruptly can destabilize established practices that have sustained the environment for years. But by spreading information and resources on how to travel and explore responsibly, our adventures can further propel conservation efforts. 

One of the best ways to do this is by spreading this awareness on social media. Maryville University states that activism on social media invites this positive action by increasing visibility through sharing and networking. Social media can uplift users to coordinate community responses, share lived experiences, and amplify a united voice for collective action.

How to Use Social Media to Promote Environmental Awareness
Use Empathetic Storytelling
Adopting an empathetic voice on social media, blogs, or other digital formats lets audiences be exposed to the human side of climate stories. Our post ‘Fires and Floating Trash’ details the writer’s struggle to avoid California’s wildfire smoke in 2020, only to be faced with pollution even under the refuge of Coastal Redwoods. It emphasizes the value of being immersed in nature and the disappointment and motivation to do better when encountering pollution in the wilderness. Going digital allows us to tell stories like this — stories that show the relevance of these issues to all of us and our communities as well.
Share Concrete Steps
Empathetic storytelling also allows us to get more people involved in efforts against the climate crisis. A Pew Research Center survey on environmental awareness finds that there's a correlation between Gen Z and Millennials seeing more climate change content online and acting more to address the issue. This is because the content we create and consume reaches people with similar resources as us. Therefore, the solutions presented — such as responsible garbage disposal, waste management, and using biodegradable products — are more accessible to us as well.

Instagram influencers promoting sustainable travel like Vivienne Dovi (@travellingwithmelanin), Jazzmine Raine (@jazzmineraine), and Lola Mendez (@lolamendez) have produced informative travel content in this manner. They go beyond offering practical eco-friendly tips like sustainable transport and clean-up efforts. They also share stories on getting involved with climate movements, as well as experiences relevant to those belonging to historically marginalized sectors of the population.

Invite Collective Action
Not only does social media put us on the receiving end of informative content, but it also allows us to inspire and partake in discussions. It allows us to find communities with similar interests and beliefs that point us in the right direction. Here at Pathloom, we share information on how you can venture outdoors while avoiding polluting the area or disturbing the local wildlife. Whether it’s with us or with others, engaging in communities like these on social media allow for individualized methods of contributing to environmental preservation - something we can all get behind.


Whether you’re out in nature or on your mobile devices, social media gives us the capacity to make our own contributions to helping the environment. By engaging in environmental advocacy on social media, we can effectively spread information on how humanity can coexist, and do our part to give back to the natural world.


 Guest Writer Rosy Jeffersen is a freelance writer who is passionate about getting out in the world and sharing her experiences with readers. Deeply interested in social and climate issues, she believes that stories must be both informative and empathetic to get a message across.

We love exploring the otherworldly landscapes of Utah’s “Mighty Five” National Parks. But that certainly doesn’t make us special: the surreal scenery and unforgettable hiking in Bryce Canyon, Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion attracted a total of 11.3 million visitors in 2021 alone. 

Crowded trailheads, long lines, and reservation systems have become the norm at Zion, the most popular of the five parks. As a result, some visitors seem to be skipping its iconic cliffs and canyons in favor of nearby Bryce Canyon. 

Bryce Canyon, long considered a quieter alternative to Zion, is quiet no more. 2022 was its busiest spring ever, even as Utah’s other parks experienced dips in traffic following the pandemic boom.

Bryce Canyon’s famous orange hoodoos, desert arches, and twisted bristlecone pines make for some of the best hiking and photography opportunities on the planet, so the bump in traffic is certainly not unwarranted. Partly to mitigate the effects of high traffic on fragile desert ecosystems, dogs are only permitted on paved trails — so unfortunately your canine companion can’t join you on the routes detailed here. 

But for human visitors still seeking some desert solitude, do not despair! We’ve handpicked the best trails for hiking in Bryce Canyon off the beaten path.

How to Beat the Crowds Hiking in Bryce Canyon

Bryce Canyon is actually one of the smallest national parks in the nation, but its unique geography provides an abundance of hiking opportunities that belie its compact size.

Despite what its name suggests, the park is not a single canyon, but rather a collection of natural amphitheaters, carved by erosion out of the surrounding high plateau. The most popular locations are the viewpoints and trails along the plateau rim, which are accessible via the main road that winds throughout the park. 

But there are dozens of trails that allow for a more immersive experience. The following lightly-trafficked hikes descend into the park’s many bowls and canyons, offering some of the best opportunities to explore this special place away from the crowds that gather along the rim.

Fairyland Loop
Difficulty: Advanced
Distance: 7.8 miles
Elevation Gain: 2,309 feet

The Fairyland Loop could very well be the most scenic hike in Bryce Canyon. It offers endless, epic vistas of surreal desert landscapes before immersing hikers deep in the canyon walls. Start the loop counterclockwise at Fairyland Point, in the northern section of the park. You will pass unique landscape desert rock features including the Chinese Wall, Sinking Ship, and Tower Bridge.

The 7.8 mile loop combines panoramic rim-top views with canyon-bottom adventures and up-close explorations of the trail’s many hoodoos. This is a world-class trail that remains remarkably quiet. Many visitors opt for nearby Sunrise and Sunset Points, or the shorter trail just out to Tower Bridge - leaving Fairyland Loop free to explore in solitudinous glory.


The Hat Shop
Difficulty: Intermediate
Distance: 4 miles
Elevation Gain: 1,436 feet

The Hat Shop is a peculiar name for a trail, but quite fitting for the peculiar scenery that this hike features. It winds through a collection of eroded pinnacles topped by boulders that look like a series of rock-hewn hats.

The trailhead for the Hat Shop is at the popular Bryce Point. The 4 mile, out-and-back trail is on the first two miles of the Under-the-Rim backcountry trail. It starts with a nearly 1,000 foot descent into the canyon and finishes with that same steep climb back out, keeping traffic on the trail relatively sparse.

Peek-A-Boo Loop
Difficulty: Intermediate
Distance: 5.5 miles
Elevation Gain: 1,555 feet

Starting from Bryce Point, the 5.5 mile Peek-A-Boo Loop follows a steep trail through hoodoos and culminates with views of the Wall of Windows, one of the most impressive rock features in the entire park.

Past the Wall of Windows, the trail continues through the Bryce Amphitheater and endless towering red rock spires before looping back for a steep ascent up to the Bryce Point trailhead.


Sheep Creek and Swamp Canyon Loop
Difficulty: Intermediate
Distance: 4 miles
Elevation Gain: 1,026 feet

Unlike many of the shorter hikes in Bryce Canyon, such as the extremely popular Navajo Loop and Tower Bridge, the Sheep Creek and Swamp Canyon Loop is generally pretty quiet. That being said - don’t equate a lack of popularity with a lack of payoff! With expansive views of jagged cliffs, airy ponderosa forests, and an abundance of wildflowers, this 4.5 mile loop is a great half-day hike - especially in the springtime when everything is blooming.

Starting at the Swamp Canyon Overlook trailhead, the trail descends 647 feet into Swamp Canyon, winding through ravines, forests, and past imposing hoodoo formations. The trail finishes with a series of steep switchbacks back up to the parking lot up at the Overlook.

Under-the-Rim Trail
Difficulty: Advanced
Distance: 22.4 miles
Elevation Gain: 4,336 feet

Leave the crowds behind entirely by taking on the Under-the-Rim Trail, a sublime adventure in the Bryce Canyon backcountry. The 22.4 mile, point-to-point trail features over 4,300 feet of elevation gain and takes you through desert meadows, fragile pine forests, and towering cathedrals of orange-red rock.

Most hikers take two or three days to complete the Under-the-Rim Trail, starting at Rainbow Point and finishing at Bryce Point. Once finished, you can jump on the free Bryce Canyon Shuttle for a ride back to your car near Rainbow Point.

Camping is only allowed at the seven designated backcountry campsites along the trail. Overnight camping permits are required, and can be purchased at the Park Visitor Center. Keep in mind that open fires are banned everywhere in the Bryce Canyon backcountry. 

This is also black bear country—all food and scented items must be stored in bear-resistant canisters. They are available to loan, free of charge, from the Visitor Center.

Winter Hiking in Bryce Canyon

If you really want to feel like you have Bryce Canyon all to yourself, plan for a winter trip! The glowing orange hoodoos are even more impressive when blanketed in pristine snow amidst the quiet winter air. 

Sunset Campground closes and Park Visitor Center hours are reduced for the winter but Bryce Canyon National Park as a whole is open and accessible year-round! Come prepared with winter hiking layers and snowshoes, especially if you’re planning to explore the more remote trails in the park. 

As snowy trails get packed down by hikers, they become dangerously slick. Keep a pair of microspikes in your pack for added traction on icy sections, just in case. Trekking poles are also great for some added stability when ascending and descending the steep canyon trails.

Wait for the wintertime to take on these popular hikes in Bryce Canyon:
Queen’s Garden and Navajo Loop (2.9 miles): This linkup of two trails is wildly busy in the summer, for good reason! The diverse scenery includes dramatic cliffs, arches, and hoodoos, all within a manageable 3 miles, making it a classic Bryce Canyon experience.
Rim Trail (1-9 miles): Contouring along the rim of Bryce Canyon, the Rim Trail is a scenic and flat trail. It’s a great option if you’d prefer to avoid icy descents into the amphitheaters. The 0.5 mile section between Sunset and Sunrise Points is the easiest and most popular.
Mossy Cave (1 mile): This short, family-friendly hike features a creek and a small waterfall. They often freeze over during cold snaps, making for a mini winter wonderland in the middle of the desert.
Tower Bridge (3.4 miles): This natural bridge, or arch, is the park’s most popular feature. The trail features great views of Boat Mesa and Sinking Ship (an imposing rock wall) before arriving at Tower Bridge.

Winter or summer, cold or crowded, Bryce Canyon is always worth exploring - it really is that special of a place. And if you know where to look, hiking in Bryce Canyon can still feel as wild and remote as ever!

When I think of “outdoor exercise,” I’d never really considered hiking as something that could fall under that category. But after enduring so many monotonous workouts at the gym, I finally decided it was time for a little change of pace. So, about a year ago I decided to join a couple of my friends on an upcoming hiking trip. 

My experience was exhilarating and life-changing. It gave me time to slow down and admire the beauty that had always been around me. It also made me realize how you don’t necessarily have to give up one hobby to focus on another. 

Traveling can be a time-consuming undertaking, which may be why so many people have trouble fitting in a workout or two into their schedule. Fortunately, by incorporating hiking as an integral part of my various trips, I was able to see different places without sacrificing my health and well-being. 

Initially, my goal for hiking was to lose weight and fit better into my clothes. In my obsessive quest for physical fitness, I even went through a phase where I’d carry around a calorie counter, Lumen device, and pedometer with me during all my hikes. Eventually, I did achieve my fitness and weight-loss goals; however, I also learned a far greater lesson that myself and many others don’t realize at the beginning of the journey: 

The prize is in the process. 

I learned to appreciate the small things around me that I normally wouldn’t pay attention to. On top of that, I was able to connect more deeply with my body, and now understand its needs and preferences much better than I did before. 

The great thing about living in America is that you can find loads of beautiful and exciting hiking spots wherever you are in the country. Today, I’m sharing with you five of the best hiking areas in National Parks across North America that I’m sure you’ll love.

Yosemite Valley

Most people have likely heard of Yosemite Valley, within North America’s famous Yosemite National Park. It features world-renown landmarks such as Half Dome and El Capitan. It also has excellent hiking trails for all levels of experience. 

Beginners can check out the Bridalveil Falls Trail, which has a mere 80-foot elevation gain. Not so steep that you’d get winded after the first few minutes, but also not too flat for it to be anticlimactic. The trail has been closed for repairs for quite some time now, but is set to open back up within the next month or two with extensive infrastructure improvements. Meanwhile, for more advanced hikers, you can try hiking the Four Mile Trail, which has an elevation gain of 3,200 feet. 

There are also activities throughout Yosemite such as climbing lessons and tours that visitors can participate in. 

Due to its popularity, Yosemite Valley can get extremely crowded during certain seasons. More than 3.2 million people visit its hiking trails every year, mostly throughout the summer. So, if you don’t want to run into crowds of other hikers, you’ll want to time your visit right. In my experience, Yosemite Valley has the least number of visitors during the months of November through April, due to snow and extremely cold weather. 

Worried about missing out on the beautiful scenery of Yosemite during the colder months? Don’t fret - Yosemite Valley turns into a snowy wonderland in the wintertime. Hike through cool, snow-laden paths during your visit. If you have time, you could even stop by Lake Tenaya and ice skate with some friends. 

Winter hiking is a great way to burn more calories while doing something that’s incredibly fun and new. It’s also a great way to raise your resting metabolic rate, helping you burn even more calories in the process.

Arches National Park

Arches National Park in Southern Utah is known for its natural sandstone arches and beautiful red rocks. The Park is home to a wide variety of crawling and flying creatures, including mountain lions, foxes, bats, bobcats, turkey vultures, ravens, hawks, and many more.

Unlike the other Parks listed in this article, the trails here are generally much shorter and have more manageable elevation gains. So, if you’re looking for easy-to-moderate hiking trails, I highly recommend visiting Arches. 

One of my go-tos is the Double Arch Trail, which stretches 8 miles out-and-back. Most of the trail is relatively flat, so it’s perfect for beginners or families on a field trip. 

On the hike, you’ll see some of the most beautiful juniper and oak trees scattered across the countryside. And if you time it right, you can also spot Utah’s state flower, the Sego Lily, which only blooms from May to June every year.

Yellowstone National Park

Full of wondrous pools, rivers, and geysers, Yellowstone National Park is a location that every hiker needs to visit at least once in their life. Home to creatures like elk, buffalos, and sometimes grizzly bears, Yellowstone has over 900 miles of trails and around 15 miles of boardwalks. 

Yellowstone attracts more than 4 million visitors per year. Despite the park’s massive size (around 2.2 million acres), it’s not uncommon for some parts to get overcrowded during specific seasons. That being said, statistics show that more than 90% of visitors stay on the main road when they visit.

Fortunately, there are plenty of places within the park where you can go to escape the busy crowds. 

Avalanche Peak is a personal favorite, stretching 4.7 miles (out-and-back), with an elevation gain of 2,100 feet. A few minutes on this trail can make you feel a little winded if you’re a beginner - but for more advanced hikers, this should be a piece of cake. Once you reach the summit, you can enjoy a beautiful panoramic view of surrounding mountain ranges and the great Yellowstone Lake. 

For intermediate or advanced hikers, the Union Falls trail is an excellent option to consider. It stretches 16.2 miles (out and back) - much farther than Avalanche Peak. That being said, it has a much friendlier elevation gain - a mere 1,000 feet. 

After the long hike, I recommend you take a plunge in the cool streaming waters of Union Falls before making the trip back!

Glacier National Park

It’s no wonder why it’s called “Glacier National Park” – the glaciers have existed there for around 2 million years! You can find the Park resting along the border of Canada and Montana. Glacier is often referred to as the “Crown of the Continent,” featuring more than 680 lakes and 200 waterfalls to explore. There are also two mountain ranges where you can enjoy the most breathtaking scenes of the land. 

Hiking paths in Glacier have elevation gains ranging from the tens to the thousands - so you can find trails for hikers of all levels of expertise. Beginners can enjoy the Beaver Pond Loop Hike, which spans 5 miles roundtrip with an elevation gain of 350 feet.  

There are other, more challenging trails with much higher elevation levels that experts can tackle. For example, the Lee Ridge Trail is about 12 miles out-and-back, with an elevation gain of 2,094 feet. Make sure to have a companion with you during this hike, as even the most experienced hikers can have trouble completing this course.

Grand Canyon

You’ve seen it dozens of times in movies, but have you seen this magnificent gem of a National Park in person? If not, it might be high time for you to pack your bags and take a trip to the Grand Canyon. 

The Grand Canyon formation is more than five million years old. While you might not be able to find dinosaur bones anywhere in the area, archeologists have uncovered multiple ancient marine fossils that date back 1.2 billion years. 

Surveys show that more than five million people visit the Grand Canyon every year. If you want to avoid the crowds, try traversing the less popular North Rim or Bright Angel trails.

The North Rim Trail stretches 21 miles and has an elevation grain of 1,495 feet, making it a great option for intermediate hikers with the endurance to handle longer distances. Meanwhile, the Bright Angel Trail is ideal for more experienced hikers, stretching only 7.8 miles but with a steep elevation gain of 4,460 feet.

Hiking for fitness is a great way to improve your heart rate and metabolism. Additionally, it helps your body burn more calories, strengthen your muscles, and even boost your mental well-being. The internet is swimming with fitness tips and techniques you can use to begin your hiking practice the right way, and miles and miles of hiking trails to help you get there. 

Remember, the fun is in the journey, so don’t stress yourself out too much with the outcome. Setbacks and challenges are a natural part of the process. Keep an open mind and be patient with your progress, regardless of the speed. Results don’t show up overnight, but eventually, you’ll see that your hard work and perseverance will pay off. You’ll feel more energized and motivated to keep moving forward. For now, simply take time to appreciate the beauty that’s around you.

Going climbing for the first time outdoors with friends, or ready to transition from the climbing gym to climbing outdoors?  Check out our list of top climbing spots for beginners in the Bay Area to get your stoke on! This is not an exhaustive guide, but rather it is based on our extensive experience climbing with a diverse group of friends of various skill levels. 

But first, let’s go over some basic climbing terms:
Crag - an outdoor climbing area. 
Bouldering - climbing at lower heights, usually no more than 20 feet. Ropes and climbing harnesses aren’t generally used for safety, but “crash pads” are placed on the ground to buffer falls. 
Rope climbing - climbing at higher heights, at least 20 feet. Ropes and climbing harnesses are used for safety. This Is further categorized into:
Toprope climbing - where an anchor is set on the top of the route prior to climbing and ropes are dropped down for both belayer &amp; climber. Toproping is easier &amp; safer for beginners because if the climber falls, they basically just hang in position. 
Lead climbing - where the climber brings up their end of the rope (the anchor hasn’t been set yet, they will set up the anchor themselves once they get to the top of the route). This is more advanced because if the climber lets go, they will actually fall! 

Note that if you have an experienced lead climber in your group, they can climb first, and then set up the anchor for others to toprope off of (depending on the length of the route and other factors, the crags we’ve linked to in this guide will indicate specifically if routes can be toproped or not). Or, at some crags, it’s possible to simply walk around and up to the top of the crag to set up a toprope without any leading (though knowledge of how to set up an anchor is required).

Climbing is numerically assigned a difficulty grade, and most of the crags outlined below have a good number of climbing routes that would be considered beginner-friendly - at or less than 5.10 or V2. For detailed information on the routes, we have linked their profiles on Mountain Project, which is an online guide to climbing that is especially great because it’s crowdsourced! 

In keeping with the Mountain Project layout guide, headers for each area within this guide will reference their primary location, and then get narrower into specific crags, as needed.

For those in the Bay without a vehicle, Cragmont &amp; Remillard Parks in the East Bay, Ring Mountain in the North Bay, and Pacifica in the South Bay are even accessible via public transit!

For safety, we would always recommend following proper climbing practices, such as using a crash pad for bouldering, or knowing how to properly set up anchors for rope climbing. You can take a course on these at climbing gyms or local guiding companies - and we’d certainly recommend beginners going with more experienced climbers as well.

Mt St Helena &gt; Table Scraps Pinnacle

All 6 of the routes here are sport, but with grades starting at 5.7 and an abundance of holds on the easier routes, it's a great place for beginners to get their feet wet with sport climbing and anchor building. 

Mountain Project profile here
 
Lake Tahoe Area &gt; Emigrant Gap &gt; The Emeralds &gt; The Benches

A series of walls with tons of easier problems. For example, at The Dollar Store crag, even leading can feel approachable, because on several routes you'll be able to fully stand on rock to set up anchors!

A little bonus - parking for The Emerald Pools is next to the South Yuba River bridge, and many folks will hike down to the river for easy swimming, strolling or picnicking. If you explore the backcountry around the area, you also might just find a secluded lake perfect for deep water soloing - which is bouldering over water - so instead of falling on crash pads, you’ll fall directly into the water itself! (And this spot is not even in most guide books!).

Lake Tahoe Area &gt; South Lake &gt; Eagle Creek Canyon &gt; 90 Foot Wall

What makes this area especially great for beginners is that you can walk up to the top to set anchors for toproping, which means it's also a great place for folks just learning leading skills to practice by mock leading (where they’re tied into a toprope for safety but are carrying up a secondary rope to pretend or “mock” lead). There are also a good quantity of routes to practice on. And hello, you’re steps away from the beautiful Emerald Bay at Lake Tahoe! 

Mountain Project profile here
 
Pacifica

Right between San Pedro Beach &amp; Rockaway Beach, off-trail on the small peninsula (Aramai Point) that juts into the ocean, there are a few crags that are very well-featured, therefore leading to a handful of beginner-friendly routes! And what could be more beginner-friendly than not one but two beaches, on either side, for some downtime whenever you want?

Ring Mountain

Bouldering and more bouldering, with plenty of problems rated at or less than V2. Not to mention, the wide expanse of Ring Mountain is the perfect place for a post-climb picnic with views over the entire Bay Area!

Castle Rock State Park 

Probably the largest climbing region in the immediate Bay Area, with lots of toprope, sport, trad and bouldering problems for all different levels of expertise! There are multiple routes here in the 5.6-5.9 range, so there’s plenty for beginners to explore. 

We recommend bringing a guide book or doing your research on routes before you head over here. The cell service is limited in this area, and some of the routes require a 20-30 min hike from any parking areas. 

If you visit this park, check out Indian Rock at Sanborn County Park a few minutes up the road, which also has beginner-friendly bouldering, toprope and sport problems - all just a short 5-minute walk from parking. 

The rock at Castle Rock is sandstone, which is super fun to climb on but extremely delicate, so do not climb here during or immediately after it rains!

Berkeley &gt; Cragmont Rock Park and Remillard Park

Good news: some of the Bay Area’s most fun crags also happen to be the most accessible! If you don’t have a car or don’t want to drive too far, you can climb outdoors in the Berkeley Hills. 

Cragmont Rock Park is a particularly popular spot for beginner climbers. The cliffs are easily accessible from the road, and you can walk directly up to them to set up anchors. It gets busy here on the weekends, so arrive early to snag parking and get ready to make some new friends! 

Pro tip: If Cragmont is overcrowded, walk a few minutes up the road to Remillard Park, which has less routes but also tends to attract fewer crowds.

Berkeley &gt; Indian Rock and Mortar Rock

Literally just a few blocks away from Cragmont and Remillard are another pair of parks with some great bouldering! While there are definitely some “highball problems” (routes that go higher than 20 feet and are much riskier with respect to falling &amp; safety), there are plenty of standard height problems as well. (Note: there are some anchors that could be used to turn some highball problems into rope climbs, and never forget you never have to go higher than you’re comfortable with). Indian Rock Park also has steps carved into the rock directly to get to the top, where you’ll find a fantastic view of San Francisco &amp; the Bay Bridge. It’s a popular place to hang out with friends to watch the sunset!

Lake Tahoe Area &gt; Cosumnes River Gorge (CRG)

The views and climbing at CRG make the roughly 3 hour drive here from SF well worth your time! Primarily known for crack climbing (where you climb up by jamming your hands and feet into a crack on the rock), this area has a good number of beginner-friendly routes in the 5.6-5.8 range. As an added bonus, the granite cliffs here overlook the picturesque Cosumnes River and Gutenberger Wall, so bring your camera for pictures and pick a nice viewing spot on the Gorge for lunch.

Mount Diablo 

Most people know you can hike Diablo, but did you know you can climb here as well? Mount Diablo has a few different climbing areas, all located near each other and fairly easy to access from the parking area. Beginners should check out Boy Scout Rocks and Pine Canyon, which have lower-grade problems that can be toproped. You’ll be rewarded with lush views of the park and the Bay Area when you reach the top! Warning: it gets very hot here in the summer, so make sure to bring water and stay hydrated!

There are a few places we would NOT recommend for beginners...

None of the 3 crags within the City of San Francisco are particularly good for beginners. The bouldering areas at Glen Canyon and Cliff House are pretty loaded with “highball problems”, and the top-rope routes at Beaver Street are all in the 5.10s - not to mention the “slickenside” rock (a cool geological formation, read more here) can be frustrating for beginners trying to get a foothold.

Mickey's Beach, just south of Stinson Beach, only has 1 climb where you can set up a toprope anchor prior to climbing, and it’s an intermediate 5.10. Other problems that are rated easier must be lead climbed, but even these have sketchy first moves. The bouldering is similarly difficult, with only a handful of routes below 5.4. 

Yosemite has a huge variety of climbs, but generally they tend to be quite difficult (specifically, many people think the routes are sandbagged, which means they feel harder than their assigned difficulty grade). With respect to rope climbing there are few toprope routes. (FYI for the beginners: when buying a guidebook, be sure it specifies! Most guidebooks with Yosemite in the title and no other descriptors only cover the Valley specifically, and do not include areas in Tuolumne),

Eagerly planning your next camping trip, but concerned about confronting a snake? Understandable, especially if you’re visiting states like Arizona where there are plenty of rattlesnakes, or Missouri, South Carolina, Florida, or Kansas where there are also Copperheads and Cottonmouths. 

Most snakes are harmless, but the ones that aren’t are reason enough to take this species seriously. If you’re camping with your pet, you have even more reason to be vigilant as your dog won’t know about the dangers. They are also more likely to confront a snake and try to harass it, rather than just leave it be. 

In this post, we’ve included some helpful hacks to ensure that you and any snakes in the area can both enjoy the outdoors as safely and peacefully as possible.

Snakes and the Great Outdoors 

Going camping can be an exciting experience that strengthens your connection to nature and forces you to adopt healthy survival skills. But even the most seasoned campers can’t get too cocky when it comes to snake avoidance and safety. 

Of the 3,500 snake species found around the world, only 600 of them are venomous. However, all snakes are best left alone, whether they’re poisonous or not. And if you’re going camping, you need to know how to avoid them all as much as possible. Some areas also have far more snakes than others. 

Snakes are far more common in the southwest than they are in the northeast of the US, so it’s good to know what the risk factor is like beforehand. But regardless of where you’re camping, most snakes are just as put off by the idea of a confrontation as we are. However, there’s still the potential for accidentally scaring one, stepping on one, or attracting one into your personal space. 

Knowing how to keep snakes away from your campsite and create an environment that actively deters them will mean you get to enjoy a safer and more relaxing camping experience. 

If you’re new to camping, or simply a little terrified of snakes - fear not! We have rounded up eleven of the most useful practices for keeping snakes away from your campsite - no matter where you are or what your survival skills are like.

1. Find A Snake-Free Campsite 

Sounds a little too obvious, doesn’t it? But this practice is definitely worth mentioning. Not all campsites or nature reserves are known for having high snake populations, and picking one that has a reputation for being generally snake-free is the first step to putting your mind at ease. 

Even though Hawaii and Alaska are the only US states that are technically snake-free, there are still plenty of recreational grounds and national parks that don’t contain venomous snakes throughout the contiguous 48 states. Some prime examples include Acadia National Park in Maine, and Olympic National Park in Washington State. These two places are both known for rare snake sightings and even fewer incidents. 

In terms of campsites in locations where snakes are found in abundance, there are a few names you should avoid. Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks in California may be beautiful, but they are known for high snake activity, and thus visitors must prepare accordingly. 


2. Camp In The Cooler Months 

Generally speaking, snakes like dry, hot weather. As cold-blooded creatures, they rely on external warmth to stay healthy and keep their circulation up, so summertime tends to see some of the highest snake activity over the course of the year.

Camping during winter, fall, or early spring is going to mean a significantly decreased likelihood of encountering a snake in the wild. During the colder months, snakes are more likely to be hibernating in a dark cave, hole in the ground, or nest to conserve their energy.

3. Avoid Dense Forest Or Boulder Terrain 

Snakes like to find shelter under rocks, bushes, and dense foliage. If you’re in a dense forest or terrain that features lots of boulders, chances are there are snakes hiding where you can’t see them. 

The more rocks, leaves, tree branches and other coverage there is around you, the higher the chances of a snake (or several) in your area. If you want to avoid snakes while camping, you should always aim to pitch your tent in a clearing, where there are minimal hiding spots for slithery critters. Wide open spaces are unappealing to snakes because it means they don’t have anywhere to hide or blend into. Avoiding condensed natural areas is one of the most effective ways to prevent unwanted interaction with a snake. 


4. Avoid Areas Next To Water Sources

Contrary to popular belief, snakes are great swimmers. Many species use lakes, ponds, and other water sources as a channel to travel and hunt, as well as to escape predators. Many of the animals that snakes would hunt as prey live close to water sources, so it’s definitely an attractive area for roaming snakes. 

Even though camping close to a body of water has many benefits for us humans (hydration, swimming, cleanliness, etc), one of the few downsides is that snakes may like some of those ideas just as much. If you camp near water, be mindful of this, especially if there’s an abundance of foliage that goes right up to the edge of the water.


5. Keep Your Food In Airtight Containers 

While snakes have almost zero interest in human food, leaving food out in the open can attract animals that they do want to eat. Exposed food is never a good idea at any campsite, as it can attract everything from insects to grizzly bears. You don’t want that, and neither do the campsite rangers. 

Keeping your food locked and sealed should be a standard habit when camping in the great outdoors. This will prevent prey from being drawn to your tent, and subsequently, prevent the appearance of  hungry predators. Keep your food in airtight containers, cans, or Ziploc bags to be extra safe.

6. Maintain A Tidy, Clutter-Free Campsite 

There are several compelling reasons to keep your campsite as clean and tidy as possible. To begin with, it’s just good practice to keep an organized environment. But more relevant to this article, you reduce the chances of attracting snakes. 

As we’ve already discussed, snakes love to burrow, hide, and nestle under things that they can either camouflage into or use as a source of protection and warmth. Leaving chairs, tables, trash bags, and other random items strewn about could present an enticing hideout for a nearby snake. 

The less clutter you have around you, the less appealing your campsite will be to passing snakes. With any luck, they’ll see a relatively bare clearing with a tent or two, and move on about their snakely business. 


7. Make Your Presence Known

For the most part, snakes want to avoid us just as much as we want to avoid them. If you make your presence known, they’ll get the message that you’re near and will likely do their best to stay out of your way. 

A good way to do this is to stomp loudly on the ground, as snakes ‘hear” through vibrations. Not only is this an effective way of alerting snakes to your presence, it’s also far less likely to disturb other campers enjoying the peace and quiet than it would be to shout to the heavens. 


8. Always Check Your Tent, Shoes, And Sleeping Bag Before Use

If there is a cozy, warm, and accessible hideaway for a snake, they’re likely to take advantage of it. It’s not a decision based on them wanting to bite you, they’re simply seeking somewhere safe and cozy to hide. 

Bearing this in mind, it is extremely important to check your tent, shoes, and sleeping bag before climbing into them. Like with several other of these tips, this is a standard camping practice that everyone should adopt, especially if they are particularly afraid of encountering a snake. 

If one has crawled in, a quick check could be what prevents a very startled and scared snake from lunging and biting. In addition to this, it’s also important to keep these potential snake hideouts zipped tight and sealed off in order to discourage the situation from happening in the first place.

9. Use Naturally Pungent Snake Repellents 

There are loads of natural snake repellents that you can use to deter snakes from entering your personal space, and most of them are probably in your kitchen cupboard. Snake skin is absorbent, so anything highly acidic or pungent is going to put them off. 

Sprinkling any of the following natural products around your campsite will quickly have them slithering in the opposite direction: 
White vinegar 
Clove oil 
Garlic and salt solution 
If you want a really strong repellent, you could even combine all of these ingredients into one wide-nozzle spray bottle for a seriously potent anti-snake solution. Due to their absorbent skin, these pungent chemicals will cause a lot of discomfort for a snake. They’ll avoid any ground that these are sprinkled on.   


10. Don’t Buy Into Artificial Snake Repellents 

A quick online search will affirm that there are plenty of artificial snake repellents on the market. However, these repellents also often cause harm to humans and the environment, and not just to snakes.

Instead of buying into overpriced, bio-harmful artificial repellents, stick to the ones listed above or adopt practical snake avoidance techniques, they are much more effective. 


11. Watch Where You Walk

If you walk recklessly around a nature reserve, you may accidently tread on a resting snake. Once that happens, they will feel attacked and may attempt to strike. Unfortunately, this is the cause behind many fatal snake bites. 

Fortunately, there’s a simple solution: watch where you are going, especially when walking through dense areas where snakes are easily hidden from the casual observer.  

As anyone who enjoys spending time in nature knows, you’re the intruder, not them. Be sensitive to the environment and with any luck, you can spot a snake before it spots you.

Camp In Harmony With Nature

One of the most important things to remember about snakes is that they are trying to avoid you just as much as you are trying to avoid them. 

If you do happen to come across a snake in your campsite, sleeping bag, shoes, or anywhere else, it’s best to back away slowly and quietly. Then, keep watch to see where it slithers off to. If the snake doesn’t leave, you can use a long stick or a broom to move it along - but only if it’s safe to do so. Another option (if fires are allowed) is to light a fire and direct the smoke towards the location of the snake. 

Whatever route you take, always err on the side of caution, do not provoke the snake, and do not trust that it’s sleeping and safe to pick up and relocate. And even if the snake appears to be dead - beware Snake Zombies, because that’s actually a thing.

When planning your next camping trip, remember to be vigilant, cautious, and respectful of these beautiful (albeit often dangerous) reptiles. After all, they were here first - you’re in their home, not the other way around!

After an action-packed celestial calendar this Summer, the final Supermoon of 2022 will be the perfect way to cap off the schedule of heavenly phenomena. If you have been following our Supermoon series through the June Strawberry Supermoon and the July Buck Supermoon, or if you are new to astronomical observation, you won’t want to miss the Sturgeon Supermoon this Thursday, August 11th!

Summer may be coming to an end, but fear not - there is still plenty of time and plenty of reasons to get outdoors and enjoy the nice weather, including this week when you can experience the Sturgeon Supermoon. This full moon will peak at 6:35pm PST on August 11th, so read on to see how you can make the most of it. 
 
What is a Sturgeon?

Sturgeons are a species of fish that can live up to 60 years, measure up to 22 feet long and weigh up to 1,800 pounds!
There are 29 species of Sturgeons native to the Northern Hemisphere, found in oceans, lakes and rivers.
As Sturgeons have undergone relatively few evolutionary changes over the last 419 million years, they are considered primitive fish (and look kinda creepy if you ask me!)
Large species of Sturgeons can swallow whole salmon, despite having no teeth!
Sturgeon species are endangered due to exploitation from commercial fisherman for their high quality roe, used in caviar.

The naming of the August full moon draws from Algonquin tribes native to Eastern North America, who relied on sturgeon spawning in the Great Lakes for sustenance in the late Summertime. Though their abundance has greatly declined, there is still an opportunity to observe the spawning season of the largest fish in North America. There are many places across the US where you can find them, including California, the Midwest, and the Great Lakes regions. 

Make sure to plan an overnight trip to attempt to find populations undamaged from local urban centers, and to properly take advantage of this final Supermoon of 2022. If you plan to try dispersed camping this August to escape the hustle of popular campsites, make sure to comply with federal guidelines!

Where Does the Sturgeon Supermoon Name Come From?

While the sturgeon populations native to the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain in North America inspired the honorific commonly used today for the August moon, cultures across the globe have drawn inspiration from the world around them to label this phenomenon. Some of these alternate names include…

The Celts refer to the August full moon as the Lynx Moon, named after the glowing eyes of the Lynx.
Anglo Saxon culture has many names for this moon according to various natural processes occurring in the month of August, including Corn Moon and Lightning Moon.
In Māori culture, while the moon does not have a specific title, it falls in the month of Mahuru on their lunar calendar, named for the Earth beginning to warm as the Southern Hemisphere transitions from Winter to Spring.
Also following Southern Hemisphere climate conditions, the Zulu tribe in South Africa refer to this month as uNcwaba, for a man returning from an extended trip, as with Springs return.
Other Native American tribes throughout the country have a variety of names for the full moon of August, including Harvest Moon, Black Cherries Moon, Ricing Moon, Flying Up Moon and Mountain Shadows Moon.
In parts of Southeast Asia, the month is celebrated with the Hungry Ghost Festival, honoring the spirits of the dead with opera, incense and paper money burning, and dragon dances.

How and Where do I View the Sturgeon Supermoon?

We see full moons when the sun and moon are on opposite sides of our planet. For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, at around 9pm PST on August 11th, 2022, the moon will pass by the south of Saturn by only 4º. This means they will be on the same celestial longitude and thus be in conjunction. 

If you have sharp eyes (or a telescope) and are looking towards the skies that night, you may be able to see the constellation of Capricorn surrounding them - however the bright light of the planetary conjunction will likely wash it out. 

Instead, try casting your eyes toward the constellation of Taurus, where you may be able to catch a glimpse of Mars, with its distinctive red coloring. Mars will rise just after 9pm PST. Mercury, Jupiter and Venus will also be visible, from around 6pm, 1am and 1:30am respectively.

If you want the full experience of stargazing for this Sturgeon Supermoon, we at Pathloom would recommend cowboy camping, where you sleep without a tent, directly underneath the stars... Although, if you’re anything like me, you may struggle to stay awake long enough to see Venus out in the tranquility of nature! 

Between the Supermoon and the various planets shining on August 11th, you might have had your cosmic fill… but for enthusiasts out there, the Perseid meteor shower will also be active! In 2022 this stunning display of ice and rock swirling around our earth has been visible since mid July, until the end of August, and peaks the same night as our Sturgeon Supermoon (as well as the day after on the 12th). This is one of the most popular meteor showers for viewing, so pack some coffee and get out there to see what all the fuss is about... and keep your fingers crossed that the light of the full moon doesn’t wash out any hopes of seeing the meteors!

As we embark on our last month of exciting Summer days, long Summer evenings, and balmy Summer nights, don’t let yourself get stuck into a Summer rut. The next Supermoon the world will get to experience won’t be until July 2023, so get outside, surround yourself with the natural wonders our country has to offer, and don’t miss the last Supermoon of 2022, the Sturgeon Supermoon!

 
The moons may have come and gone, but the information Caitlin wrote about them is still fascinating! Check out Part 1 of our Summer Astronomy Series about Supermoons - June's Strawberry Supermoon, and Part 2 about July's Buck Supermoon!

Cooking over a fire when on a hiking, thruhiking, backpacking, or camping trip can be a challenge. Bringing the ingredients for meals, and the cookware to cook them in, to feed a large group of people means having to carry everything on your back. When cooking fantastic meals for a crowd at a campsite, whether it’s close to your car or deep into the forest, simplicity is key.

Here are some ideas for great meals with few ingredients that use only a small pot of water or a roll of aluminum foil - or are similarly easy to prepare. The fewer the ingredients and camping gear for cooking needed, the lighter your pack will be, and the farther you’ll be able to travel as a result!

Many of these recipes are adaptable, and you can add proteins or other ingredients depending on your diet and preferences. They are simple, and also can be scaled from one or two campers up to a large group of people.

 Check out these other great camping recipes &amp; camping meal ideas on the Pathloom blog, from simple meals like these to the ridiculously complex!

Rice and Veggies

Having a tasty rice dish with veggies can be easy. Packing pre-measured portions of rice and diced veggies will ensure your meal will be light enough to fit in your bag and easy to cook over a fire. All you’ll need is a small metal pot to cook it all together over the coals of your fire.

Ingredients:
2 cups of rice
1 cup of water
Diced veggies of your choice, i.e. peas, carrots, green beans, broccoli

Add all ingredients to a cold pot. Bring water, rice and veggies to a boil. Remove from direct heat, but make sure it is close enough for the water to stay at a slight boil. Once the water is fully absorbed, the rice should be cooked and the dish should be ready to go. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper, and serve. 
 
Tacos/Fajitas

Tacos or fajitas are an excellent choice for a delicious camping meal. Tortillas are extremely lightweight and fit easily in your backpack, as do the other ingredients. Using dry black beans in a Ziplock bag can save even more space and weight in your pack as well. Other ingredients like onion and chopped lettuce will also keep relatively fresh for several days in a Ziplock bag in your pack if needed.

Ingredients:
Tortillas
Dry black beans
Chopped lettuce, green onion, and bell peppers
Hot sauce (optional)

In a small pot, rehydrate beans in water. While waiting for this process to finish, you can heat the tortillas on a hot rock near the fire or by holding them briefly over the fire (careful with your hands if utilizing this method!). 

Once the beans are cooked and soft, add them along with the vegetables to the tortillas. Using a bit of hot sauce will give this meal a little extra kick.
 
Ramen Noodles

Instant ramen noodles are popular in campsites and dorm rooms all over the world. A camper can turn a package of instant noodles into a filling meal over a campfire just as easily as a college student can using a hot plate in the dorm. 

A couple of packets of ramen and these other ingredients weigh next to nothing in your hiking bag, and will provide you with the energy you need for the trail. 

Ingredients:
Package(s) of instant ramen noodles
Green onion, bell pepper
Beef or Vegan jerky

Using a small pot, saute the veggies and/or jerky. Set them aside when done, then boil water in the pot. Once boiling, add noodles and cook for a few minutes until tender. Cooking separately takes a bit more effort, but will retain the flavor of the veggies and ensure nothing gets overcooked. Serve and enjoy! 
 
Loaded Sweet Potatoes

This is a play on the classic loaded baked potato. Sweet potatoes are delicious, and far more nutritious than their not-so-sweet counterparts. When they are done you’ll have a complete meal full of fiber and nutrients.

Ingredients:
Sweet potatoes
Salt and pepper
Green onion
Red pepper
Black beans (optional)

Slice potatoes down the middle and wrap in aluminum foil. Place them in the coals and turn occasionally, checking them until they are mostly cooked through. Take them out, open them up, and load them with green onions, diced red pepper, salt &amp; pepper, and black beans. Wrap them back up tightly in the foil and continue cooking until the middle is completely soft.
 
Cajun Style Foil Bake

This is a take on a Cajun tradition. All the ingredients can be prepped at home in advance, wrapped in foil together, and put in a sealed bag for transportation - making it easy to bring with you on your outdoor adventure. 

You can make a giant batch to cook altogether, or create smaller separate foil packets for individual servings - you just open the foil once it’s done cooking, let it cool a bit, and start eating! No dishes to clean. You can add fish or jerky to this recipe as well for some extra protein.

Ingredients:
Corn cobs
Bell peppers
Zucchini
Salt and pepper
Chili powder
Paprika
Thyme
Hot Peppers (optional)
Black beans (optional)
Shrimp, fish, jerky, or vegan jerky (optional)

Break up corn cobs into 2-3 pieces and wrap in foil with your protein of choice, peppers, zucchini, onions, and butter (you can use beans instead of or in addition to corn). Add hot peppers if you want some kick. 

Putting the foil cooking packet too close to the flames could burn both the foil and your food, so place it on a grill or a rock on the fire ring and keep an eye on it. Cook time depends on the size of the packet and the heat of the coals, but your meal should be ready in about 20 minutes.
 
Kebabs

Cooking meat and veggies over a fire is as old as, well, cooking. Making kebabs is simple and takes very little in the way of materials. They can be vegetarian or made with meat as well, depending on your preference and diet. Like other recipes on this list, you can prepare all of the ingredients, and the skewers as a whole, ahead of time. 

Ingredients:
Bell peppers
Zucchinis
Onions
Mushrooms
Favorite BBQ sauce
Beef or Chicken (optional)
Metal or Wood skewers

Soak skewers (if made of wood) for a few hours before cooking to prevent them from burning over the flames. Cut veggies into large pieces, and marinate in BBQ sauce. Slide pieces onto skewers, alternating between veggies - for example: pepper, zucchini, onion, mushroom etc. Hold over coals or flame, turning as it cooks. Be careful when using wood skewers as they can burn and break. 
 
Grilled Cheese Pitas

Grilled cheese sandwiches are possibly the easiest meal to make, ever, anywhere. Cheese and bread, what can be more simple than that? Hard cheeses such as cheddar or Monterey Jack travel well when wrapped in wax paper and plastic wrap. Pitas are flat, easy to carry, and more durable than traditional sliced bread when jostling around in your hiking pack.

Ingredients:
Hard Cheese (Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Fontina, Havarti, Gouda) cut into slices.
(for vegans, a harder vegan cheese such as Field Roast Chao Cheese works best) 
Pita bread
Butter/vegan butter

Cut or tear open the pocket of the pita. Fill the pocket with cheese. Cook the sandwich on a rack or grill if it is available in the camping site, or you can just put it on a flat rock near your fire. You can get creative and add veggies of your choice into the pocket for some added nutrients. Adding some butter before cooking can give you even more flavor.

Final Thoughts

Besides the actual food items you bring with you, make sure you leave room in your backpack for seasonings. Packets of salt, pepper and hot sauce will go a long way to making your meals interesting and tasty. You can store other spices in Ziplock bags or small jars as well to bring along with you. 

Cooking for a large crowd with very little in the way of ingredients and equipment may seem daunting, but it will give you a chance to get creative by simplifying the process as much as possible - while still making delicious meals for your entire party.

Among the outdoor pursuits that more people have started to take up since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, astronomy has seen one of the largest surges. According to recent reports, retailers within the astronomy industry across North America have seen increases in sales between 60% to 400%. On top of this, many local astronomy clubs have seen an uptick in interest and serious inquiries. Considering that for the better part of two years most people have been cooped up inside, this makes a lot of sense.

Astronomy, as a hobby, is deeply rooted in the outdoors and beyond. By connecting to the world and the celestial bodies we exist with, many find this activity both therapeutic and invigorating. That said, in order to really make the most of the stargazing experience, there are some items that you ought to have.

The Right Telescope
While casual stargazers can make do with the naked eye or perhaps binoculars, you need a telescope to truly unlock the beauty of deep space. For beginners, experienced astronomers recommend first learning about manual astronomy telescopes, as this will teach you the essential tech foundations. Thankfully, many beginner-friendly models now compromise by offering manual models with smartphone support. Case in point, the StarSense Explorer requires the user to guide the telescope itself—but this is made much easier through their companion app that shows celestial objects currently visible, and charts a path for whichever specific one the user chooses to view. Plus, since it’s relatively lightweight at around 18 pounds, this telescope is very portable for astronomy hobbyists who want to venture to more remote locations. That said, before making any telescope purchase, it’s also best to try it out in-person. This way, you can gauge if it works well for your own individual preferences and needs.

Stargazing Guides
Although you can easily stargaze from the comfort of your own backyard, there are certain times and places that can seriously enhance the experience. To pinpoint these, you need resources specially created to determine dates, times, and coordinates where the skies are darkest, where there is ideal visibility, and exactly when certain events are bound to occur. Fortunately, many of these resources are freely available today. For instance, on Pathloom we recently shared 2022 guides to upcoming meteor showers and planetary conjunctions. These include the active dates, optimal viewing times, and best viewing areas for certain astronomical events.

In addition to resources available on our site, there are also quite a few mobile apps that you can utilize. For example, Google Sky shows users the exact placement of planets at any given time. Meanwhile, apps like SkEye can help you identify stars, planets, constellations, and more. Some apps (like the ones that accompany the aforementioned StarSense telescope) can even be used as guides for telescopes. Through such resources, you can educate yourself about astronomy, and ensure that each stargazing trip will reveal something new and exciting.

Astronomy Log Book
An astronomy logbook is one of the key items you’ll need to hone your hobby. More than just a notebook of ramblings, a logbook represents a systematic way of recording observations. This will allow you to note interesting patterns and phenomena that may otherwise go unnoticed - which can help make stargazing far more exciting and rewarding in the long run.

As a rule of thumb, astronomy logbooks are typically notebooks with good quality paper and a hardback. This will help ensure your ink won’t smudge, and it will be less likely to rip or stain after repeated use. Since logging your observations can be fairly intimidating at first, you can also use free downloadable observation forms. Using these will make it easy to learn what to take note of, and what to start jotting down later once you start your own logbook. Over time, you may even find you have a personal approach that can help you find the planets or galaxies of your choosing.

A Comfortable Tent
Stargazing can often feel like a waiting game, and the best views often require quite a bit of travel. Light pollution from nearby cities or towns can make it harder to see the night sky properly, which is why experienced astronomers recommend visiting optimal stargazing spots that are far from civilization. As such, these places will likely be in undeveloped areas that may not be the most accommodating for the long stretches of time you’ll want to allocate for the task.

Therefore, in order to increase the range of how far you can go and how comfortable you’ll be in these remote locations, consider bringing a tent to protect yourself and your equipment. Though camping tents are fairly straightforward, some things to keep in mind include the size and the weight. If you’re a solo hobbyist, then a single or two-person tent will be more than enough and easy to lug around. Just keep in mind that while it’s useful to bring a solid rainfly for protection should it suddenly rain or snow, it’s better to remove this so you can view stars through the mesh top. Even if your mesh top is thicker and obstructive to your view, though, a tent is still handy to have as a home base where you can take breaks through the night.


Stargazing is undoubtedly a great hobby for those who want to connect with the vast and mysterious universe. It's an activity that is both scientific and creative, and that you can enjoy whether you’re out solo or with your friends or loved ones. And who knows? As you start setting up those telescopes, you may even find yourself discovering more things about yourself - or the universe as a whole - under the great starry sky above.

July can be a busy time of the year. Organizing Independence Day festivities, the hustle and bustle of school holidays, and the malaise of summer heat can leave you feeling a little drained. Here is how to take advantage of the Buck Supermoon this Wednesday, July 13th, to reinvigorate your mind, body, and spirit.

The Buck full moon is named for the emergence of antlers on the heads of buck deer during the month of July. This year, it will be a supermoon, meaning the moon is at its closest point in orbit to the Earth at the same time as the full moon phase. When these two cycles coincide, the result is an unusually large and bright moon which bathes the nighttime landscape in a beautiful, ghostly light.

The moon cycle, while beautiful, has earthly implications beyond just aesthetics. Any fisherman knows that the gravitational pull of the moon affects the tides as it orbits the Earth. During a Supermoon, the moon is uncharacteristically close, and thus the tides will be higher than usual. The Buck Supermoon will be the closest of 2022, just 222,000 miles from our planet - 124 miles closer than last month's Strawberry Supermoon. (If you missed our post about the June Strawberry Supermoon, you can check it out here!)

The moon can also impact activity within the animal kingdom, from hunting and migration patterns, to coral spawning, and even circalunar rhythms - similar to the circadian rhythms we are likely more familiar with. Many of these patterns have been well documented, but still hold much mystery as to why the lunar cycle seems to trigger zoological phenomena around the world.

For centuries, lunar cycles have been thought to affect human moods as well, with ancient scholars connecting the full moon to spikes in irrational behavior. Many studies have shown that the bright light resulting from a full moon can reduce the quality of your sleep - obviously even more so during an extremely bright supermoon! This is because the increased levels of light may increase sleep latency, or the time between the initial stages of sleep and REM. REM sleep is important for memory coding, hormonal regulation and muscle repair. If your time spent in REM is decreased around the full moon, you may feel irritable, off-balance and fatigued. Some connection has also been made between the lunar cycle and cardiovascular health, other studies have found that participants have lower blood pressure around the full and new moons. 

Here are some activities you can do in the Outdoors during the Buck Supermoon this July to refresh and recharge both body and mind.

Meditate

Meditation, controlled breathing and mindful activity can sometimes be difficult to do at home. Between the persistent temptation of wifi, the noise of urban living, and people who rely on you, carving out time for yourself is tough. The full and new moons are the pinnacles of the moon phases, and a powerful spiritual time to reflect and recharge away from the stresses of work and the household. Check out a dark sky park near you for the ideal place to look inward with minimal distractions.

Take a Hike 

Although the temptation to curl up in front of the TV when you are low on energy is strong, much of the time this will make you feel even worse the next day. The physical result of minimal activity for an extended period can leave your muscles stiff and harm your quality of sleep. Regardless if you are a fan of vigorous treks, or more into chill strolls, a hike will allow you to channel your energy into something productive. On top of the natural increases in dopamine and serotonin that exercise induces via endorphins, you can also end the day proud of your accomplishments. 

The Buck Supermoon this year will peak at 11:37am PST, so you will be able to see it all throughout the day - though it will be far more brilliant after the sun has set.

Relax Out in Nature

Ever wonder why stock imagery posted everywhere from airports to desktop backgrounds to dentist’s offices select pictures of nature for us to look at? Studies have shown that looking at nature causes reductions of stress, and increases self esteem as well. Nature can serve as a distraction from our own problems, and a reminder of the beauty of the world around us. Here are some beautiful camping sites where you can take in the scenery around you during the day, and see it bathed in light from the Buck Supermoon after the sun has set.

Connect with Friends and Family

Take advantage of the holiday season and balmy weather this month by spending time with those closest to you. Hiking can bring a group together in pursuit of a common goal, and brings a sense of unity by achieving something together. Ditch the screens and spend some quality time in nature at these idyllic sites close to the city, where you can bond over a trail and sleep next to each under the full moon. Don’t worry, you can be back home in time for Sunday chores!

Cook a Meal Outdoors

Although the frozen section at Trader Joe’s goes hard, (shoutout to their famous pork and ginger soup dumplings), there can be something gratifying about making your own meal from scratch. Cooking over a campfire takes patience, and this return to basics can be restorative and calming. Whether you’re a beginner or a MasterChef, there are soulful camping recipes out there for everyone. And don’t worry about taking lamps to see your meal while you eat - the light from the supermoon will take care of that! (OK, maybe take a few lamps just in case some clouds roll in.)


The Buck Moon, also known as the Salmon Moon and Berry Moon, is a time for reinvigoration, and exploring the outdoors under the unusually bright night sky. So if you are feeling tired from the midyear slump, or simply want to get out and enjoy the warm summer nights, block off your calendar for the closest, biggest, and brightest full moon of 2022 - this Wednesday, July 13th!

Taking your four-legged friend camping can be a great experience for you both. 
If you and your dog already enjoy exploring nature together, what better way to do so than to spend a night under the stars with each other? However, there are a few things you need to know before you go camping, and in this guide we’ll cover them all!

Keeping Your Dog Safe 

When it comes to camping with a furry friend, safety should be the number one priority. In most wilderness areas wildlife roam freely, and even in quieter areas you might have poisonous plants, gushing rapids, or steep, rugged terrain to watch out for. 

Like most animals, dogs are curious creatures, and chances are they’re even more excited than you are to explore the campsite and surrounding areas. You can only do so much to protect them, so it’s essential that you have everything you need in case of an emergency. Always be prepared to treat injuries, dehydration, accidents, or encounters with a plant or wild animal. 

Here are some useful things to bring along: 
General first-aid kit – a no-brainer for any camping excursion, pets or no pets. Just remember that your pet medical aid kit may differ a bit from the one you have for yourself. Your kit should include all the basics: bandages, ointments, tweezers, gloves, and shock blankets, along with the following items: 
Saline solution – if your pup gets sand, skunk spray, dirt, or some other foreign object in their eye, a good wash with saline solution will help soothe them.
Anti-sting medication – Benadryl (diphenhydramine) can be used to soothe allergic reactions to insect bites, poisonous plants, and a wide variety of allergens found throughout the wild. 
Multi-tool – perfect for cutting bandages, removing thorns, quills, and splinters, cutting off hangnails, and hundreds of other outdoor emergency situations. 
Electrolytes – for preventing dehydration. Just make sure you get a brand that is canine-friendly.

Preventing Your Dog from Wandering Off 

Dogs love wandering about, especially when they’re in an exciting natural environment. If they have never been camping before, the excitement may be even harder to contain.
 One way to prevent escapist behavior is to invest in a clip-on lunging rope or retractable leash. This will allow them to roam in a way that feels free of confinement, but still connects them to you in a safe and practical way. 

In the event that your dog does decide to go on a solo adventure, you’ll likely need some help to find them. Utilizing a reflective collar or some clip-on lights can be extremely helpful for tracking them down at night. 

Letting your dog roam freely might feel tempting (especially if you are in a remote area), but there are many risks to doing so. You are their primary guardian; anything that happens to them or with another animal/person is your responsibility. Keep them close at all times and make sure they stay visible.

Warning Signs to Look Out for 

As beautiful as the wild outdoors can be, it can also be dangerous or even life-threatening without the proper preparation and education. Depending on where you are camping, you may be sharing territory with bears, porcupines, snakes, wolves, coyotes, and other animals native to the region. 

Furthermore, there may be poisonous plants, extreme weather patterns, or even wildfires to contend with. Here are some common warning signs to look out for in the wild, and what they mean for you and your canine companion. 
Tracks and droppings – most of the animals you want to avoid will leave tracks, droppings, and other signs of recent nearby activity. Researching the relevant signs of wildlife in advance in the area in which you are camping can help you avoid their territory while hiking or camping. Tracks may also lead to bear nests where they sit and eat, so if you see clusters of sticks on the ground or in a tree a bear could be close. 
Poison Oak and poisonous berries – Poison Oak can grow just about anywhere, so be on the lookout for any vines or shrubs that have groupings of three oak-shaped leaves (often tinged with a reddish sheen). If you spot poison oak, keep your dog well away until you’ve passed the area. You may also come across potentially hazardous berries. A good rule is to always steer clear of any berries in the wild unless you know exactly what they are and that they cannot harm your pet. 
Smoke – a telltale sign that a fire is near. You may also notice birds and other creatures fleeing from crowded natural areas when a fire is approaching. If you see smoke, it’s time to move as fast as possible in the other direction. Fire travels fast, so you’ll need to do the same.
Weather signs – a sudden change in weather often causes birds to go quiet as they seek shelter, or for them to fly away in large flocks. If it gets eerily quiet, have a good look at the sky and see if you can spot rain or thunderstorm clouds. Other signs to watch for include a sudden increase in wind, a wind that changes direction or an increase in cloud cover.
Snakeskins – snakeskins imply the presence of a live, healthy snake. You need to keep a close watch on your surroundings as snakes are often highly camouflaged to avoid detection. If your dog spots a snake they’ll certainly be interested in making its acquaintance, so keep your eyes open!
You and your dog can avoid most encounters with dangerous wildlife by stomping loudly, staying alert, and always keeping all food (for both human and canine!) in sealed pouches.

Sleeping Arrangements 

Considering the many common nocturnal dangers of the great outdoors, most parks have a rule that animal companions share your tent at night. Co-sleeping is one of the best ways for both you and your dog to stay safe while camping—and it will mean you both get to enjoy some extra warmth at night.

Making Your Dog Comfortable as Possible 

Just like humans, dogs need comfort and warmth to stay happy and healthy, and this is especially true when trekking through the unpredictable wilds. Your pup will need their own bedding, blankets, bowls, and access to food and water through every step of their journey with you. 

Depending on the size of your dog and the weather at the time of your trip, ‌ consider investing in a weatherproof jacket or coat for extra warmth for your companion. This can also protect their bodies from scratches, bites, or other surface-level injuries that may occur while hiking. 

If you anticipate covering a lot of ground or ground that is harsh, spiky, arid or freezing, a pair of canine booties will also do your dog a world of good. 

Bonus tip: If they have a favorite toy that makes them feel safe, bring it along to soothe them in case of anxiety.

Food, Snacks, and Water 

Plan to pack your pup’s food in an airtight, waterproof container. This will prevent food smells from attracting other animals, and will also prevent rations from becoming waterlogged in case of rain or wading through a river. 

The best dog foods for camping are dry kibble or freeze-dried raw foods. They’re lightweight, filling, and can double as easy treats for when your dog is being a good girl or boy.

Transitioning from Day Trips to Overnight Trips 

Depending on the personality, breed, age, and health of your dog, transitioning from day trips to overnight ones can take some time. You both need to be fit enough to tackle any terrain, and if this means you need to work more on certain muscles, the chances are your dog may need to do the same. 

Once you’re fit and ready, you can begin the adjustment process by starting off with full-day trips (preferably close to home), and eventually working your way up to overnight and even multiple-night camping expeditions. What’s important is that your dog has all of its familiar physical and emotional needs being met, just as they would at home. And remember, being over-prepared is always better than being under-prepared. 

Be sure to pack everything necessary for a safe, comfortable journey, and remember to give them plenty of love and attention every step of the way!

About Stanislaus National Forest:

Stanislaus National Forest is a National Forest in California that offers many outdoor recreational activities for all walks of life: hiking, camping, offroading, overlanding, vanlife, backcountry activities, water and snow activities, bird watching, stargazing, rock climbing, scenic driving and much more! The forest encompasses 898,000 acres and multiple counties: Alpine, Calaveras, Mariposa, Tuolumne and Stanislaus County.

The National Forest shares its southern boundary with Yosemite National Park, its northern boundary with Eldorado National Forest, and its eastern boundary with Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. Its proximity to Yosemite makes it especially attractive for those looking to escape the busy crowds of the popular National Park, while still being one of the most accessible national forests from the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Stanislaus National Forest has three primary corridors: Highway 4, Hwy 108 and Hwy 120. The three corridors envelope and provide access to 811 miles of rivers and streams, 78 lakes and 86 named mountains, which offer an escape and solitude from the hustle and bustle of urban life. The forest is popular for its varying natural beauty and picturesque landscape, from foothills to raging rivers to the high Sierras, ranging in elevations from 1,500 feet to the highest point in the forest, Sonora Peak, at 11,453 feet. Other notable peaks include Dardanelles Cone at 9,527 feet, The Three Chimneys at 9,882 feet, and Night Cap Peak at 10,641 feet. These all lie within the Hwy 108 and Hwy 120 corridors, while Highland Peak at 10,936 feet is accessible via Hwy 4. Notable mountain passes include Sonora Pass at 9,643 feet, Ebbetts Pass at 8,730, feet and Monitor Pass at 8,314 feet.

The lakes, rivers, and wilderness areas of Stanislaus are popular for their diversity in landscape, as well as their flora and fauna. The 3 wilderness areas, Emigrant Wilderness, Mokelumne Wilderness and Carson-Iceberg Wilderness, are designated as “Special Places” by the US Forest Service, and require permits for overnight stays. The forest's notable rivers and streams include the Stanislaus River, Tuolumne River and Cherry Creek. Noteworthy lakes include Cherry Lake, Utica Reservoir, Alpine Lake, Mosquito Lake, Pinecrest Lake, Spicer Reservoir, Leavitt Lake, and the Highland Lakes. 

For outdoor recreational purposes, the forest offers 62 developed campgrounds for both National Forest RV camping and tent camping. It also has many National Forest dispersed camping areas for those who prefer primitive camping in California. The forest represents a great option for camping in the Sierras, and for camping near Yosemite as well. There are over 3,000 miles of National Forest roads and trails for various uses: hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, offroading/OHV, etc.

Trip Overview:

The Highway 108 corridor provides access to some of my favorite areas in Stanislaus National Forest, offering amazing opportunities for free camping in Northern California, hiking in the Sierras and off roading as well. Opportunities for camping for free in California can be few and far between, hence regions like Stanislaus National Forest are great for a weekend escape - which is exactly what this trip was! If you are looking for other options near Yosemite, camping in Sierra National Forest is another great alternative, providing access to the National Park from the southern boundary.

On a Saturday afternoon in July, I set out from the San Francisco Bay Area for an overnight solo road trip to Stanislaus National Forest. I decided to do the Hwy 108 corridor to avoid the smoke from raging wildfires to both the north and the south. I ended up in the Sonora Pass area, opting for high-altitude dispersed camping after a bit of offroading to get there. It took quite a bit of time - traversing various trails and encountering many other dispersed campsites occupied by other campers, but I eventually stumbled upon a truly epic campsite.. It offered views of a vibrant sunset and solitude, which were just what I had been striving to find all along!

After turning in shortly after sunset in an effort to get an early start the next day, I woke up to clear blue skies in the morning. I ate some breakfast, packed up camp, and departed for some daytime adventures. I off-roaded towards Leavitt Lake, but found the road a bit too bumpy and rocky for my vehicle, forcing me to turn back. I instead made my way to the Trail of the Gargoyles for a short hike around the area, before eventually making my way back home in the evening. After spending the past several months in Colorado, this short trip was an ideal re-introduction to camping in the high Sierras, rejuvenating some nostalgic memories. There’s just a unique feeling I get when I am in the Sierras, I feel more at-home there than anywhere else I have traveled to.

Trip Planning:

Permits:

Permits are required for campfires. Depending on where you’re hiking or spending the night, permits may also be required for Wilderness Areas. Due to the widespread wildfire activity during the summer season, most areas do not allow campfires in the summer season. Be sure to check wildfire activity and fire danger levels before embarking on any trip to this area, especially in the summer and fall months. 

Camping:

There are many developed and dispersed camping options throughout the forest, spanning from rivers and creeks to high-elevation areas. Some of my favorite developed campgrounds in the forest are Clark Fork and Pinecrest Lake. It is important to pay attention to regulations for dispersed camping. There are many scattered areas of private property throughout the forest as well where camping or outdoor recreation of any kind is prohibited. Also, keep in mind that cell phone service is limited throughout the forest, especially in the more remote areas.

Itinerary:

Day 1: Bay Area to Sonora Pass

On a Saturday afternoon, I embarked on a spontaneous overnight solo Stanislaus National Forest camping trip. I’ve been to Stanislaus many times for camping in the high Sierras - at least twice a year for the past 6 years - so I’m very familiar with the forest and its various areas. I opted to do some Hwy 108 camping near Sonora Pass, as it offered a narrow window to avoid smoke from wildfires in the surrounding regions. I could have opted for  a campsite near Yosemite National Park or within the Park itself, but decided to avoid the crowds and do some National Forest camping instead. Camping in a National Forest vs National Park varies in the camping experience itself: National Forests are great for free camping options, but are generally more remote and primitive - whereas National Parks tend to be more expensive but offer more amenities and often a more developed camping experience overall. Plus, Sonora Pass is overall one of the best regions for Sierras camping, offering high elevation and respite from the summer heat - so it was a no brainer for me. 

I arrived in the Sonora Pass area around late afternoon and decided to scope out some of my previously visited known campsites for potential availability. Since I was arriving on a Saturday afternoon, at the peak of the summer season, I doubted I’d have too much luck at some of the more accessible and known sites, so I instead ventured onto some unpaved trails. After finding several of my favorite dispersed campsites occupied, I trekked further down the road and eventually lucked out on a campsite that was available - with amazing views of the surrounding high peaks and valley below! It can often be hard to find quality campsite opportunities in California during the peak summer season, but based on both my experience and my tolerance for exploration I knew I’d be able to find something regardless of the crowds.

I quickly set up camp and started to soak in the high peaks all around me - it never gets old! The sunset hour was magical - there were clouds pouring in above the high peaks not too far from where I was, and the sunlight refracted and reflected from those clouds to create a vibrant display of colors in the evening sky. It went through phases from intensely golden to deeply purple, eventually fading into a light pink before the grays finally set in. I didn’t stay up too long past the sunset as I had ambitious plans for the morning - although I made sure to catch some stars before calling it a night.

Day 2: Sonora Pass to Bay Area via Trail of the Gargoyles

I woke up to pristinely clear blue skies - compared to the cloudy scenery I had experienced the evening before. It was a refreshing feeling after such a peaceful night’s rest; camping in the Eastern Sierras has become an annual ritual for me now. After a light breakfast, I soaked in some views and started to pack up camp. By 11 am, I was all packed up and ready for some exploring. 

I started driving towards Leavitt Lake, a place I’d hiked to before, but had never driven to. The dirt trail started off fairly smooth, but as I got closer to the lake it got bumpier and bumpier; eventually to a point that I started to question if my vehicle could handle the terrain. From previous hikes to the lake, I remember the last mile being especially precarious, with some challenging obstacles that would certainly give my vehicle some trouble.

It’s imperative to take caution when doing more adventurous things, like I was doing in this case: you don’t want to end up getting stuck or hurt miles away from civilization. I was about a mile away from the lake at this point, and things were really starting to get bumpy. I could definitely hear some “clangs” and “tings” coming from scraping the bottom of my vehicle against rocks. The way some of the rocks were angled, it almost seemed like an obstacle course for my undercarriage. I decided to exercise caution and stop before a particularly daunting rock formation in the road - I just knew something would break if I pushed further. 

Making the decision to stop is the easy part - finding safe ways to turn around on a narrow, single-lane, dirt road can be a daunting process on its own. Fortunately, I’ve had a lot of experience in these kinds of situations that I could rely on to help me turn around safely. It took  what felt like a 30-point turn, but eventually I got the job done, and Ifound myself safely pointing back the way I came without any more bruises on my vehicle. I eventually managed to navigate my way back to Highway 108, and set off towards the Trail of the Gargoyles.

As I arrived at the trailhead for the Trail of the Gargoyles, I saw many cars in the parking lot, as well as some mountain bikers just getting back to their vehicles after what seemed like a fulfilling ride - judging by the exhilaration on their faces. I grabbed some water, a book and a hat, and started the short hike to explore the various rock formations and amazing scenery all around. 

The Trail features stunning volcanic rock outcroppings of all shapes and sizes, jutting up in spires all across the cliff sides. The stunning array of colors radiating from the vibrant green forest below only serve to make the scenery that much more dramatic. Standing near the edge of a cliff, questioning how these formations amassed such a peculiar shape, makes for quite the curious and contemplative environment.

After a mile stroll down a clearly marked path, dodging fallen branches strewn across narrow cliffsides - made all the more difficult as I was still in flip-flops - I turned a corner and suddenly the eponymous Gargoyles loomed before me. Once you see these monstrosities, you can understand where the formations get their name - it really feels like you’ve been transported to some medieval movie setting. 

After enjoying the scenery, I found some shade under a tree and caught a few good pages in my book. It was tranquil and extremely relaxing, to just blend in with everything in the vicinity. It was the perfect place to just lie down on the ground and pretend you don’t exist - sometimes that’s all that’s needed to ground your perspective and find your own personal moment of reflection. Camping - dispersed or developed - is my favorite mode of outdoor recreation, and this quick weekend escape was just the rejuvenation I needed after what had already been quite a busy summer.

If you find yourself in the Northern Hemisphere this summer, you’re in for an astronomical treat. The celestial calendar of 2022 is stacked with supermoons, with the summer months of June, July, and August boasting one such phenomenon apiece. 

Supermoons occur when the moon is at the closest point of its 27 day orbit to Earth, and is in the full phase of the 29.5 day lunar cycle. This occasional combination makes the moon appear bigger and brighter to observers on the ground. The last time we saw three consecutive supermoons was 2016, over the Fall months. 

The farther you are from civilization, the easier it’ll be to experience the supermoon without light pollution getting in the way. So pack up your camping gear and escape the artificial lightscape, because the first supermoon of summer is right around the corner on the night of June 14th!

The Strawberry Supermoon we will be able to observe in June has long marked the weeks following Spring and heading into Summer, symbolizing prosperity and abundance for all. The name “Strawberry Moon” draws upon (you won’t guess this one) the ripening of strawberries. 

According to The Old Farmer's Almanac, first printed in the 1700’s, the name was coined by the Lakota, Ojibwe, Dakota and Algonquin Native American peoples. This title is the most commonly used in North America today, but the Strawberry Moon has been called many different names by many different cultures over the years, including:

Honey Moon
Rose Moon
Hatching Moon
Green Corn Moon
Flower Moon

Naming conventions for monthly full moons were historically used to track and celebrate the coming of seasons and natural phenomena, and these names have stood the test of time.

If you are spiritual, the Strawberry Moon has extensive symbolism rooted in folklore and astrology around which this full moon might have meaning for you:

Best time to marry (yes, really)
Best time for adventure based romantic getaways
Best time to go offseason shrimping and crabbing
Intensifies love, luck, optimism and opulence
Signifies new life and opportunity
The celestial calendar in Sagittarius (see what that means for you here)

According to NASA, a supermoon is defined by being approximately 226,000 miles from Earth, meaning it is in its 90% perigee. For those who do not work at NASA - like me - the perigee is the closest the moon comes to Earth within its orbit, with the apogee being the furthest point. 

During a supermoon event, the proximity to Earth means the moon can appear up to 30% brighter and 14% larger than during regular full moon phases. Not to get confused with eclipses or planetary conjunctions where the moon can appear colorful or completely dark, the magic of a supermoon is in the bright light that it paints the landscape in.

So where in North America are the best places to observe this lunar event? 

Depending on the specific landscape, such light can have a remarkable impact on the surroundings. Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve will have growing and shifting shadows on June 14th. Nighttime visibility will be at its peak during supermoons and the stark, rocky terrain of Arches National Park will appear striking and ethereal.

Death Valley National Park also has some of the best conditions for moon, shooting star, and meteor shower observation in the country. We would recommend checking out the salt flats at Badwater Basin once the sun has gone down. The mountains that rise 360º around the entire valley block out any trace of nearby artificial illumination, creating a stunning visual experience as the moon rises over the horizon.

If shadows and otherworldly scenes sound too creepy (shoutout to my fellow solo campers) not to worry. There are a myriad of certified International Dark Sky Parks around the USA that will let you clearly observe the supermoon and other nighttime phenomena with minimal artificial light interference. (Check out where you can find a Dark Sky Park near you!)

These parks are ideal for the astronomy enthusiast because artificial lights from cities and urban centers lessen your ability to see distant, fainter light sources. While the remote deserts of the Southwest obviously present optimal light pollution circumstances, there are plenty of great places to view astrological phenomena throughout the country. Plan an overnight stay in one of these parks, such as Cherry Springs State Park in Pennsylvania, to experience some of the best star and moon observation conditions on the planet. (Bonus points if you cowboy camp!)

For all my telescope and astrophotography enthusiasts, or if you simply want to verify if the moon is, in fact, made of cheese, a supermoon is the ideal time to look at the craters and mountains of the moon. This is both because it is closer than usual, and the ultra bright reflected sunlight washes out other faint sources of light which usually interfere. 

So if you enjoy...

Breathtaking nocturnal scenes, 
Romantic and adventurous lunar tidings 
Getting together with friends to celebrate the coming of summer, 

… and are based in North America, the moon will peak at 7:52am - but the best viewing will be just after sunset. So make sure you are looking Southeast on Tuesday, June 14th, 2022 to experience the Strawberry Supermoon! 


Stay tuned for our upcoming blog updates to enjoy this three part Summer 2022 Supermoon series.

  One of the best ways to have an affordable outdoor adventure vacation is to go camping, especially when utilizing dispersed campsites, which typically offer free camping options. Along the Oregon Coast, there are several great free camping areas, that feature amazing Oregon hikes, waterfalls, and other beautiful landscapes - offering tons of outdoor activities that you can fill your days with. 

You may want to keep in mind that because these areas are free and lie on BLM land, they are always first come, first serve. You can expect them to be much busier on holidays and weekends, so we would suggest getting there on a Thursday or early Friday if you can’t make a mid-week visit work. Many of these areas tend to be more secluded, which makes for an extremely peaceful outdoor experience - but it also generally makes them harder to reach. Some may require you to have a vehicle with off-roading capabilities. Van, car, and tent camping are typically the best options - it will likely be hard to find a large enough spot to support an RV, and these sites certainly won’t have hookups.
 So, let’s take a deeper look at each of these amazing, free, Oregon Coast dispersed campsite areas and dive into what makes each one so special - what waterfalls, lakes, or hiking trails to watch out for - and what type of gear you might need while you are there.

Tillamook State Forest
 Tillamook is near Portland, Cannon Beach, and some of the other Northern Coastal towns of Oregon, which makes it an excellent option if you are looking for an affordable way to get away from the city for a few days. What makes this area special is that it allows you to find your little piece of paradise, where you can wake up on the river, grab your canoe or kayak and start your day right away. There are some easily accessible hikes around that lead to amazing views throughout the region as well. 
 Oregon Hikes at Tillamook State Forest
 The weather in this area tends to be highly variable depending on the time of year. Expect heavy amounts of rain from the fall through the spring - summer conditions will be dryer, but as this is the Pacific Northwest you cannot rule out the rain over these months as well. 

To ensure you have the gear you need for this affordable outdoor vacation - just keep scrolling! We will recommend the optimal gear for these trips - and help you find some of the best deals to ensure you’re fully prepared for your next Oregon Coast camping or hiking trip.

Smith River Falls

Smith River Falls is more centrally located on the Oregon Coast, near Eugene and Reedsport. There are some great waterfalls for swimming in the summer, and there are tons of dispersed campsites off the Smith River Road, along with free camping at the Smith River Falls Campsite. The Falls themselves are located a short distance away from the campsite - easily walkable, but you can drive there as well. The area also provides a boat launch. Unlike the Tillamook area, Smith River Falls is only open during the summer months, from Memorial Day through the end of September. 

This area is excellent for swimming with the kids, seeing bald eagles and other wildlife, boating, and all sorts of other aquatic activities. It is a great place for the whole family, however like most of these free areas they get extremely busy during summer weekends and holidays - just something to keep in mind when planning your affordable outdoor adventure vacation. 

Since this area is only open during the summer months weather conditions aren’t quite as variable, however as previously discussed you still can’t rule out the rain on any given day. There is plenty of shade, but we would still highly recommend sun protection - as well as  a bit of rain gear in case those summer showers do roll in.

Mount Hebo is located right off Highway 101, and has some of the best free dispersed campsites on the Oregon Coast. It is close enough to Portland to make it a great affordable outdoor vacation destination for people in the city, but it is even closer to Salem, between Tillamook and Lincoln City on the coast. Mount Hebo camping offers amazing views of the Pacific Coast on a clear day, and is perfect for an Oregon Coast day hike on the Pioneer Indian Trail in the Siuslaw National Forest. 

Dispersed campsites in the area are open year-round, but during the winter sites can be almost impossible to get to due to rough road conditions. Even during the summer months, smaller camping vehicles are better - 4 wheel drive is recommended. The Mount Hebo area is great for hiking, swimming, and seclusion
. 
The weather in Mount Hebo is similar to Tillamook, with varying conditions featuring lots of rain starting in late fall through the spring. Be sure to prepare well depending on the time of year you visit!

Gear List &amp; the Best Place to Find It

To make sure you have the right gear required for your desired outdoor activity, you may want to  investigate buying secondhand. Purchasing used equipment is an affordable and sustainable way to buy gear for your next adventure on a budget. Used purchases are all about the overall life cycle of gear - too much gear collects dust that has plenty more usage left. You will not only be helping your wallet, you will also be maintaining the circulation of gear, which helps sustain our planet for future generations. 
 Rerouted is a great place to find secondhand gear. Rerouted’s app is designed to make buying, selling, and donating secondhand gear easier, faster, and more affordable. Its mission is to make secondhand gear people's first choice. Rerouted makes outdoor gear more affordable so that no matter what your budget is, they can help you create your next outdoor adventure. 

To make your next affordable outdoor adventure to Tillamook State Forest, Smith River Falls, and Mount Hebo easier we have included a list of camping gear and outdoor gear that you might want or need while you are out there.

(published 5/9/2022)

"Death Valley is the largest US national park outside of Alaska, encompassing over 3,000 square miles of desert in California and Nevada. You can drive for hours without seeing a single car or human, just endless expanses of sand and rock with nothing man-made in sight. Bouncing up and down on these desert roads, you can imagine yourself to be a space explorer, or perhaps an extra in “Mad Max: Fury Road.”

Whether they are hidden botanical gardens in the city, the majestic peaks at Garden of the Gods, a picnic at your local park, or a nearby day hike, these small activities can yield significant boosts to your mental health."

Read below for more information about National Park Permits, and be sure to check the Park website in advance when planning a trip!
 
Backcountry permitting is an important tool used by forest and wilderness personnel to preserve the integrity of outdoor spaces - both the beauty of nature itself, as well as the solitude it provides. Too many people on the trail can lead to damage to plantlife, alienation of crucial wildlife, increased risk of erosion and water pollution, and other various adverse effects on the environment. To ensure the safety of the natural resources we love so well, rangers need to implement permit regulations to help preserve the land for future generations to come. 

In speaking with current and former park officials, we’ve found that many people tend to be either unaware of the requirement for obtaining a backcountry permit for hiking/camping, or unfamiliar with the process by which to obtain one. Please consider this article as a resource to help lay out some important considerations, and ideally clear up some of the confusion surrounding backcountry permitting. 

And don’t worry! For the most part, fees associated with backcountry permits are nominal at best, and most (if not all) of the money spent goes directly back into preserving the land!

Plan in advance!  
 Your first step in the permitting process is to do some research on the area you’re planning to backpack in. Find out what land management agency is responsible for the area, so you can determine what sort of permits are required prior to your departure. We’ve provided links to some of the most common agencies at the bottom of this article. 

Bear in mind that some of the State and National Parks require reservations to be made anywhere from 3 months to an entire year in advance! You’ll want to check this first - you don’t want to spend all your time researching trails just to find out you won’t be able to hike any of them for months to come. Many of these areas have a lottery system for awarding permits, so if you have your heart set on a particular area, you’ll want to do your homework to figure out what sort of timing gives you the best chance to obtain a permit. Pay close attention to the lottery rules too, as some areas only give you a small window to confirm your reservation after the lottery concludes or else they’ll put it back up for grabs. 

If you’re having trouble finding pertinent information regarding your target area, you can always call the local ranger station for details. They’ll be able to direct you to the proper channels for permitting - and may provide you with some good recommendations for trails and dispersed campsite ideas for your trip!

Map it out! 
 Get an idea of what trails you’d like to hike, and where you’d like to camp over the course of your trip. While this is a good strategy to identify how to prep and what you want to see in the region in general, in some cases backcountry permit applications require you to identify which dispersed campsites or areas you’re targeting for camping when making your reservations. 


Arrive Early!
 Recognize that for some parks, reservations are entirely different from permits. In many cases, reservations must be converted to permits at the local ranger station on the morning of your trip (or in some cases 24 hours in advance), or else the reservation will be released for walk-up backpackers. It’s important to read your confirmation letter clearly, to ascertain what time you’ll need to arrive to secure your permit. If there is any confusion about this, contact the ranger station to be sure.

No reservation? No problem! (Hopefully)
 It’s important to note that the vast majority of wilderness areas set aside a good number of walk-up permits on a first-come first-serve basis - anywhere from 40-66% of permits won’t require a reservation in advance… if you can get to the ranger station before they run out. These walk-up permits are often free, and typically only available up to 24 hours prior to the date of your trip - so the earlier you arrive (within 24 hours of course), the better chance you have of securing a backcountry permit for yourself and/or your group. This is especially true in summer months, when good weather leads to increased competition for these permits.

Please remember that many locations that have offered walk-up permits in the past may be temporarily unable to offer this service due to office closures related to Covid-19. In some cases, such as at The Enchantments in Washington State, these walk-up permits are being re-released for reservation availability on a weekly basis. Check your destination’s website to see if any concessions are being made while the pandemic persists.

Call Ahead!
 It’s always a good idea to call the local ranger station a day or two before your trip for any last-minute information, especially if you’re planning on traveling a significant distance to get there. On rare occasions, disasters such as landslides, wildfires, or global pandemics can lead to trail closures, and may force alterations of your best-laid plans. A budget cut or, again, a global pandemic, could also cause in-person services to be closed, meaning there may be special instructions to secure your permit. A quick phone call in advance can potentially save a lot of hassle later. 


Resources!
 Here are some of the most common land management agencies that oversee hundreds of millions of acres of land throughout the United States:
Bureau of Land Management - If you’re looking in the Western US, there’s a good chance you’re looking at BLM land (they oversee 12% of the land area of the country, primarily in the Western and Pacific states.)

US Forest Service - Not all USFS lands require permits for backcountry trips, but many of the more popular ones do, especially in Wilderness Areas. It’s best to check in advance, just in case. 

US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service - FWS administers millions of acres of wildlife refuges throughout the country, many of which can be camped on.

National Park Service - The NPS governs many of the larger, more popular parks throughout the country. Keep in mind Covid restrictions tend to be even tighter in these areas, so be sure to do your homework prior to departure! The NPS is also a great resource to learn about proper bear safety techniques.

Recreation.gov - Use this site to book backcountry permits the same way you’d do so for developed campsites. 

Fire Permits - depending on the region, you may be required to obtain a fire permit when backcountry camping. They’re free, it’s responsible, and the process only takes a few minutes. 

Pathloom.com - we’re not biased or anything, and we may not manage millions of acres of land, but we think Pathloom is a great resource to help plan your trip!

Life’s challenges can often feel overwhelming. Even a seemingly average day can easily spin out of control, provoking your worst instincts and impacting your overall mental health. It’s no wonder that prescription rates of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications are on the rise. But did you know that there are other, more natural ways to calm your mind and raise your mood? 

According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, a simple walk outside has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression. So, when the world feels heavy, turn to the great outdoors for some natural relief. Here are some tips from Pathloom to get you started.

Start Simple

You may be thinking, “I can barely get all of my responsibilities done as it is. How am I supposed to get back into nature?” Start with a walk during your lunch break, or go outside and play with your dog. Stepping away - even briefly - from technology and deadlines can do wonders for your mental health.

Instead of taking your lunch in the cafeteria or at your desk, sit outside. Simply being outdoors, listening to the birds, and soaking in some sun can reduce stress and lift your mood. According to LifeWorks, a little sun can boost your serotonin levels, which “helps reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety while boosting your mood.” 

And for those times that you truly can’t get outside, bring a little of the outside into your work and living spaces. VeryWellMind reported that nearly 3 out of 4 survey participants felt that their indoor plants improved their mental well-being during recent isolation periods, and “More than 55% of respondents said they wished they'd had more plants in their homes at that difficult time.”

Just Get Outside

The weekends should be a time to relax and rejuvenate, but many of us spend that time catching up on our favorite movies and shows. While there’s nothing wrong with a little binge-watching, try swapping out your tv time with a short nature outing. No matter where you live, you’ll find some little piece of nature ready for you to explore. Whether they are hidden botanical gardens in the city, the majestic peaks at Garden of the Gods, a picnic at your local park, or a nearby day hike, these small activities can yield significant boosts to your mental health.

With a little research, you may even find some hidden historical gems in your neighborhood. See how many you can find, and then plan a little self-guided tour of your city. Let yourself walk around places you have never thought to explore, and perhaps learn something in the process. In fact, learning something new promotes brain health, which also supports improved mental health!

Explore the World

If you have the time and resources, take some bigger leaps into the natural world. An inexpensive way to start is camping. You can borrow or rent a few supplies, secure a campsite nearby, and have a great unplugged weekend connecting with nature. If you travel with the whole family, you can take in everything the outdoors has to offer, and even enjoy fun activities like looking for constellations, planetary conjunctions, or meteor showers in the night sky or tracking storms. 

Ready for something bigger? Look into longer vacation travel or farther destinations. Getting out of your daily routine can give you a new perspective and boost your self-esteem. Travel often puts you out into nature, too. Depending on where you go, there will be trails to hike, paths to cycle, cafes to enjoy outdoors, and sites to explore. 

Taking care of your mental health is very important. Your mind and body are connected, so if you aren’t taking care of one, they both will suffer. Being proactive with your mental health can help prevent burnout and illness. So the next time you feel worn down by your routine, pick yourself up and get out! Soak up some Vitamin D, let your toes touch the earth, and explore something new. Your mind and body will thank you for it!

 At Pathloom, our mission is to get more people outdoors, more often. We believe everyone should have access to the benefits and beauty of nature, and that the current stressful and disorganized trip planning process should not prevent anybody from doing so. Send us a message. We’d love to hear from you!
 Guest Blogger Camille created Bereaver after she went through the ups and downs of the bereavement process herself following the loss of her parents and husband. With the help of her friend who was also experiencing a loss of her own, she learned how to grieve the healthy way, and she wants to share that with others. There is no one way to grieve, but it is important to do it in a way that supports your physical and mental health throughout.

Seven Tips for Traveling Solo in Death Valley
How to make the most of your trip to the desert

Last year I drove across the United States solo and spent six months exploring the outdoors. I hit many of the outdoor classics in the West – Bryce Canyon, Zion (the “adult Disneyland” for adventurers), Moab, and Arches in Utah; Red Rock Canyon State Park in Nevada, Joshua Tree and Anza Borrego in California. 
 Of all these places, Death Valley was quite the unexpected gem. Coming out of crowded parks in Utah and Colorado, Death Valley is blissfully quiet. Death Valley is the largest US national park outside of Alaska, encompassing over 3,000 square miles of desert in California and Nevada. You can drive for hours without seeing a single car or human, just endless expanses of sand and rock with nothing man-made in sight. Bouncing up and down on these desert roads, you can imagine yourself to be a space explorer, or perhaps an extra in “Mad Max: Fury Road.” 

Even if you love spontaneous travel, given the extreme environment in Death Valley it’s good to do a little bit of planning. If you’re looking to explore the alien landscape of the hottest place on Earth, here are seven tips for your Death Valley trip:

Mosaic Valley Trail: Death Valley National Park, CA - Photo Credit: Julia Atkinson 


#1 Hit the hiking trails early

Not only is it beautiful to watch the sun come up over the desert, if you do these hikes at sunrise, you’ll be able to stay much cooler. You may even be able to squeeze in two short hikes before the heat of the day sets in around 10:30am. Here are some starter hikes between 2 and 7 miles to check out:
Golden Canyon and Gower Gulch Loop
Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes Trail
Fall Canyon Trail
Panamint Dunes Trail
Darwin Falls Trail
Titus Canyon Narrows
Mosaic Canyon Trail

#2 Check out the ghost towns &amp; Badwater Basin

There’s plenty of weird stuff in the desert. Rhyolite, just outside Death Valley, is a Gold Rush era ghost town with unique art installations scattered among the remnants of the old town. The tables next to the old train station are also a great spot to picnic after a morning hike in the park.

Death Valley itself has many other fascinating ghost towns including Ballarat, Chloride City and Panamint City. 

Badwater Basin, at 282 feet below sea level, is the lowest place in the United States. The 200 square mile stretch of salt flats is certainly worth a visit.

#3 Download offline maps and share your location

There’s very little or no cell service in most of the park. There are many resources online that will allow you to download maps in advance, like Pathloom and maps.me. Sharing the trailheads for the hikes you’re planning to do with friends or family before heading into the park is a great idea. If you have the resources to invest in a Garmin inReach, this is also a good way to share updates on your location without cell phone service.

#4 Avoid visiting in the summer (unless you love extreme heat!) 

Death Valley is a great place to visit in the late fall, winter, or early spring. After April 15th, the park removes the rangers from the campsites due to the heat. For the past two summers, Death Valley has recorded temperatures as high as 130 degrees in July and August, some of the hottest measurements ever recorded. So if you’re planning to tent camp at sites like Furnace Creek, be prepared for excessive heat and wind by late April.

#5 Bring a full gas can

Gas stations are few and far between, especially if you go deep into the park. There are gas stations inside Death Valley at Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek, but gas can be $1 or more per gallon versus outside the park. If your car is an older model, it may also be a good idea to have coolant on hand as well.

#6 Bring lots of water and a medical kit

Unsurprisingly, it’s very hot and dry down in the hottest and driest place on the planet. Make sure you’ve got enough water jugs for hiking, or in case your car breaks down. Though on the pricey side, the gas stations mentioned above also have a good selection of water and cold drinks. You should also bring a medical kit for hiking and be aware that there may be rattlesnakes on these hikes.

#7 Consider bringing a high clearance vehicle with four-wheel drive

Though all of the hikes mentioned above are reachable without a high clearance vehicle, sections of the park like The Racetrack are not. If you’ve got the resources to bring a car with four-wheel drive and a high clearance, it’ll open even more sections of the park for you to explore.  


Overall, don’t overlook Death Valley for your next National Park adventure. The remote landscape there is unlike any other park in the west or beyond. And don’t forget to check out the stars – the lack of light pollution makes for amazing stargazing!

"As the snow begins to thaw, temperatures rise, and Spring begins to bloom across the country, many prospective rock climbers are turning their attention to the mountains in anticipation of a summer full of action. But imagine getting to the base of a cliff, ready to get climbing, and realizing that you don’t have all the necessary tools to make the ascent - how frustrating!"

"The drive out of Vegas slowly turned from noisy traffic and flashing lights to incredible scenery. The hour-long drive to the northeast slowly brings you back out into the desert, where you are greeted with bright red sandstone hills and cliffs everywhere you look."

 Editor's Note: This article, originally published on August 2nd and updated on November 3rd, 2021, has been refreshed as of May 2022 to reflect a current schedule of meteor showers for the duration of the year. We'll be updating this post every few months to provide you with the most relevant information regarding upcoming sky events worth staying up late for!
 
Meteor showers are some of the most exciting and breathtaking sky events you can witness - but if you’re not careful, they can be easy to miss! That’s why we at Pathloom decided to put together a comprehensive list of every meteor shower that will be occurring for the remainder of 2022 - beginning with the Eta shower that peaks this coming week! We're also including dates for the two total lunar eclipses (May and November), as well as the two Supermoons of the year (June and July), when the proximity of the full moon makes it appear larger in the night sky than at any other time! Get your cameras, binoculars, and/or telescopes ready! 

Viewing conditions vary around the world, and some meteor showers are much more visible from the Southern Hemisphere. However, at this point in our company’s lifecycle the overwhelming majority of Pathloom’s community is US-based, so we tried to list the best locations to view each shower domestically. We hope to provide a more international perspective in coming years, but for now we’ll focus on our local readership.

So mark your calendars and get trip planning! Remember that you’ll only need to find a location without much light pollution, and arrive with enough time to find a good view of the sky to see something truly beautiful. You can use this tool to find the best places to stargaze near you - and if you’re new to stargazing, check out our article on planetary conjunctions for a more comprehensive look on how to view constellations! Remember, meteor showers are typically named after the constellations that they appear closest to, so for the most ideal views find that constellation and set your sights there. Good luck, and don’t forget to make a wish!

Trip Info:
Trip Type: Car camping 
Season: April 2021 (Spring) 
Location: Valley of Fire State Park, NV; Horseshoe Bend, AZ; Antelope Canyon, AZ
Duration: 4 days / 3 nights
Total distance: 287 miles

Overview:

Often this region of the United States is known for the iconic Utah National Parks or the mighty Grand Canyon. However, sometimes venturing beyond the boundaries of these world-renowned parks can offer unique experiences that you can’t find anywhere else. 
 The Valley of Fire State Park, located about 50 miles northeast of Las Vegas, was established in 1934 as Nevada’s first State Park. The area is known for its bright red Aztec sandstone that has been shaped by the wind over thousands of years. The park is open daily from sunrise to sunset, with an entrance fee of $10.00 for in-state visitors and $15.00 for non-NV residents. Beyond the landscape enriched with history, the park offers first-come first-serve camping and a multitude of hikes.

It seems rather odd to think a magnificent place such as this one, is located less than an hour drive from such a dazzling metropolis - commonly referred to as the brightest city on Earth as seen from space.. You truly can find epic landscapes where you least expect them. 
 Horseshoe Bend and Antelope Canyon are both located just outside Page, Arizona. This small scenic town in northern Arizona is known for its Navajo culture and close proximity to several National Parks and Monuments: Rainbow Bridge National Monument, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Vermilion Cliffs National Monument are all nearby hidden gems that also display the vast history and geological wonders of the region.

 Trip Planning:
Along my journey to all the National Parks in the continental United States, I made a pit-stop in Las Vegas after visiting Great Basin National Park. Although it was nice to eat at a real restaurant and not cook on my Coleman stove for a night, I was eager to be back on the road to the next epic camping spot under the stars. That camping spot became the iconic Valley of Fire State Park, which came highly recommended by several people along my journey - and it did not disappoint! 

After that, my initial plan was to stop at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Unfortunately, in late April the North Rim is not yet open for the year, so I decided to make a visit to Page, AZ instead to see Antelope Canyon. Most trips through Antelope require a permit, click here for more info on that process. It wasn't until I got to Page and did a quick google search that I realized that the region was also home to Horseshoe Bend. I ended up staying a few nights in Page, visiting memorable landscapes and having some of the most relaxing days of my trip. 

Camping:

Camping in either of the two campgrounds in the Valley of Fire State Park is first-come first-serve. You can learn more about camping here. 

There are several campgrounds in the Page, AZ area, all of which would make for an excellent jump-off point to explore Horseshoe Bend and Antelope Canyon. You can find more camping information here.

Itinerary:

Day 1: Driving from Las Vegas, NV to Valley of Fire State Park
 The drive out of Vegas slowly turned from noisy traffic and flashing lights to incredible scenery. The hour-long drive to the northeast slowly brings you back out into the desert, where you are greeted with bright red sandstone hills and cliffs everywhere you look. I took my time on the drive and enjoyed the scenery and arrived at the park around 5pm - just in time to set up camp, go on a short walk around the campground and cook dinner before the sun went down. 

There are two campgrounds in the park that are both first-come first-serve. Fortunately I was able to find a spot in Arch Rock Campground, and in retrospect I probably would have arrived earlier in the day since it was relatively full by the time of my arrival. Although both campgrounds have restrooms and water, the other campground, Atlatl Rock Campground, has showers as well. I made myself at home camping among the red rocks, read my book in my hammock, cooked dinner and planned some sights to see for the next day.

Day 2: Exploring Valley of Fire State Park, Driving to Page, AZ
 I woke up in the morning, got ready for the day and checked out of my campsite. I decided to first head over to Atlatl Rock Campground to take a shower, then I began my exploration of the park. Although it was cloudy, it was the perfect temperature to do some small hikes, such as the Balancing Rock Trail, and take photos. I decided to drive the Valley of Fire highway through the entirety of the park before I started my 4 hour journey East to Page, AZ. 

The ride went by fast and I only saw a few sprinkles of rain on the way there. Once I got to Page, I found a decent crepe restaurant called Canyon Crepes and ate dinner. I drove around town, did some basic errands and stopped at Walmart upon arrival. I am always relieved to see a Walmart because (as usual) I didn't plan a campground for the night, so I knew in a worst case scenario I could camp in Walmart’s parking lot - where I spotted several other RV/van/car campers spending the night.

After some googling I decided to try Beehives Campground located across from the Wahweap South Entrance of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, just minutes outside of Page. The 6 sites had no water or restrooms available and were all full when I arrived, so I continued on up the road and parked in a pull off on the side of the road. I was assured I was able to park along the road when just after dusk a park ranger drove by and gave me a wave, and I watched a few more van campers pull off of the road in similar fashion after dark as well. I settled in and began to plan the next day!

Day 3: Exploring Horseshoe Bend

I primarily drove to Page to see Antelope Canyon, but I woke up to a cloudy, rainy morning. After my research the previous night I realized that all tours into Antelope Canyon were closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, and the only way to access the canyon was aquatically, through Lake Powell. I discovered online that Antelope Point Marina rents kayaks that you can use to kayak into the canyon. However, since it was a rainy day and slot canyons can be extremely dangerous due to flash flooding potential, I decided to postpone the slot canyon trip until tomorrow and instead visit Horseshoe Bend.

Horseshoe Bend, located just minutes from downtown Page, overlooks the Colorado River where the sandstone has been shaped into a horseshoe over time due to erosion. The entrance is located between mile marker 544 and 545 on Highway 89 on the west side of the road. The fee to enter is $10.00 for passenger vehicles, and the hike from the parking lot to the overlook is only ¾ of a mile. Although the overlook was decently crowded, I was able to find a spot to sit down, take some photos and relax. The views were breathtaking! 

I returned before dusk to the same spot as the previous night and was able to take a walk down the road as the sun was setting. I was able to find some beautiful vistas and catch an incredible Arizona sunset in solitude.

Day 4: Kayaking Lake Powell and Exploring Antelope Canyon

I woke up early for my final and most challenging day in Page: getting to Antelope Canyon. Antelope Canyon is a slot canyon located off of Lake Powell, just south of Page. This canyon is famous for photography of the towering, unique and swirling sandstone walls above. The canyon is within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation, and requires a permit to directly access the canyon. 

I headed to Antelope Point Marina at 8 AM to rent a kayak for the day. To begin, you must kayak through the main area of Lake Powell, then into a slot canyon until water is shallow enough for you to beach your kayak and step out. Though I didn’t quite capsize, I am glad I did not take my camera on the kayak because the lake water was choppy, and it was especially difficult paddling against the current on the return trip. The total kayak time was about 4 hours and roughly 6 miles. Bring lots of water, snacks and sun protection on the kayak - and once you get into the canyon, take your time in the calm waters.

Upon arrival at the beach you can drag your kayak onto the shore and begin to explore the amazing slot canyon. The canyon walls were stunning, and the experience as a whole was entirely breathtaking. I spent several hours exploring before returning to the marina and after a long day in the sun, I continued my journey into Utah - off in search of my next adventure. 

Gear:

For this particular 4 day segment of my trip, there were minimal gear requirements. However, because of the nature of my 6 month cross-country trip where I often slept in my car, I had to prepare for weather and conditions of all kinds. Therefore, the gear list below is comprehensive and not necessary for a basic trip like this one. Often generic and basic gear is just as useful as the top-of-the-line stuff!

National Park Week is here!

National Park Week will be celebrated by Parks across the country from April 16th-24th, 2022. This year’s festivities have been (somewhat cheesily) dubbed “sPark Connections,” with a variety of themes for online and park-specific programs for each individual day. Check out the schedule of events over on the NPS website to find new ways to learn, experience, or even get involved via a volunteering campaign. 

Earth Day (Friday, April 22nd) also coincides with National Park Week, and features many different educational and volunteering opportunities as well throughout the entire National Park System. 


As part of this week-long celebration, Saturday, April 23rd has been dubbed “National Junior Ranger Day”, and will feature dozens of in-person and online events and activities that children of all ages can participate in to learn more about their favorite National Parks. 

The ending of National Park Week also overlaps with the beginning of International Dark Sky Week (April 22-30). Many National Parks are certified by the International Dark Sky Organization as being some of the best places to view night skies due to a lack of surrounding light pollution, and several are offering special stargazing events to ring in this annual celebration.

Bear Season is Back!

Spring conditions across the majority of the country mark the end of hibernation season for most of America’s Brown and Black Bears. This means through the wilderness there will be increased frequency of bear sightings and potential for bear/human interaction - so be sure to stay as far away as possible and practice proper bear safety techniques at all times! Sure, bear cubs are some of the most adorable creatures on the planet, but their presence as bear families emerge from their hibernatory dens means their parents may be even more aggressive in their foraging for food, as well as their defense. This can present real threats to humans in wilderness areas (including many National Parks) if visitors do not exercise proper precautions.

Prescribed Burns Planned for Many National Parks Throughout Country This Spring 

As part of an initiative to maintain the unique and often delicate ecosystems found within National Parks across the country, rangers are implementing prescribed burns in various locations throughout the country. These controlled fires have long been proven to be an effective method of reducing the risk of wildfire destruction, reducing invasive plant species, and creating enriched soil to stimulate the germination of native seeds. There is evidence of indiginous peoples utilizing ‘fire as medicine’ in such a manner dating back thousands of years. These burns typically occur prior to wildfire season, when conditions are still humid from residual precipitation, temperatures are generally lower, and wind speeds are low enough to reduce the risk of the fires getting out of control. 

Parks planning prescribed burns this month include Crater Lake National Park, Cuyahoga Valley Natl Park, Wind Cave National Park, King’s Mountain National Military Park, and many others. To avoid potential closures and smoke conditions, it is highly recommended to visit the website of any Parks you plan to visit in advance of your arrival.

NPS budget for 2023 set at $3.6B

In late March, the Biden-Harris administration approved a budget of $3.6 billion for the National Park Service in 2023, an increase of nearly $500 million over the previous year. The funds will be utilized for park maintenance and improvements, but also to promote initiatives such as justice and equity for underserved communities, climate science objectives, and increasing park capacity to accommodate the increase of visitorship since the Covid-19 pandemic rekindled Americans’ love for the socially-distanced great outdoors. The NPS employs over 20,000 to care for 423 National Parks across the country. Communities in close proximity to these parks benefit greatly from their presence, to the tune of 234,000 additional jobs and $28.6 billion in total economic output - a clear sign that this increase in budget is more of an investment in the future than an expenditure.

America’s Oldest Park Ranger Retires

As has been widely reported in national media, in late March Betty Reid Soskin retired from her position at the Rosie the Riveter / WWII Home Front National Historical Park at the age of 100 years old. Soskin, who started working for the National Park Service at the age of 84, has an important perspective on the WWII Home Front because she actually lived through that era, and her familiarity has proven invaluable to the development of programs within the Park that reflect that time in American history. “Ranger Betty’s” retirement ceremony was held this past Saturday, April 16th, though according to the Park website it appears she will still be hosting weekly informal video chats every Thursday afternoon.

(published 3/7/2022)

"After accommodations and gear, lift tickets tend to be the most expensive aspect of the two sports. Lift tickets typically cost over $100 per person each day, and can even exceed $200 per day for popular resorts such as Vail during the peak season. Although the passes require a hefty up-front purchase, if you plan on going skiing frequently the pass pays for itself in about 10 days. After deciding where you want to ski, and how often you want to ski, purchasing one of the four season tickets below is the best way to make your upcoming season affordable as well as enjoyable! Most of these passes go on sale annually in the Spring, and are only available until the very beginning of that year’s skiing/snowboarding season."

"Keep up to date with the individual websites for each pass in the coming weeks for deals and discounts. It is important to note that once the season begins, all passes (except the Indy Pass) will no longer be available to purchase. For each pass there are a variety of Military, College, Youth, and Senior discounts available as well. Check each website for details on blackout date restrictions for each pass - those could severely impact your travel plans. Passes usually include discounts for buddy lift tickets, food, drink, lodging, rentals, ski lessons and lift tickets at other destinations."

"For National Parks, I had previously purchased the ”America the Beautiful” National Parks pass which permitted me entry into Canyonlands. The pass, which is valid for a year, is well worth the $80 if you plan to travel to at least 3 parks over that span. Entry fees for National Parks can be as high as $35 each, so the pass ends up paying for itself after only a few visits. Definitely a Pathloom-recommended investment!"

"A combination of timing and COVID restrictions pushed me to explore the natural beauty within the States, rather than heading abroad to new countries to get my travel fix. We often forget how much geological diversity there is within the vast landscapes of the United States - from sand dunes to reefs, mountain ranges to islands, swamps to badlands. The ability to conquer all of these landscapes and meet people from every corner of the country was truly incredible. But rather than the accomplishment of hitting 51 National Parks in under 6 months, I am most proud of what I learned about myself along the journey."

Overview:

Pinnacles National Park is one of the most accessible National Parks from a major urban setting (San Francisco Bay Area), yet it is consistently one of the most underrated as compared to some of the more popular Parks throughout California. Case in point - I live less than a 3 hour drive away, yet in all my outdoor adventures I had never before made the trip there to visit. As such, when an opportunity arose for a group camping trip, I leapt at the chance.

On a Friday afternoon, a friend and I set out from the Bay Area to make our way down to Pinnacles. We arrived at our campsite at dusk, quickly set up, and started a fire for the evening. One of our other friends joined us not too long after. We started the next morning off with some breakfast by the fire and eventually made our way out of camp.

We explored some roads further into the park but found it quite crowded on a Saturday. We decided to find a picnic area to grab some lunch, explore the area a bit more, and head towards the coast to catch the sunset. We set our sights on Gazos Creek State Beach, which was a bit of a trek but has always been one of my favorite sunset spots in the Bay Area, and made our way there.

Once we arrived on the coast, we quickly found parking and walked onto the beach. We settled on a spot and soaked in the colorful sunset with the ambient sounds of the waves crashing on the shore. It was the perfect end to a relaxing overnight weekend getaway, exactly what I needed after quite the hectic week at work.

Trip Planning:

Permits:

For National Parks, I had previously purchased the ”America the Beautiful” National Parks pass which permitted me entry into Pinnacles ($30 per vehicle without the pass). This all-inclusive pass, which is valid for a year, is well worth the $80 if you plan to travel to at least 3 parks over that span. Entry fees for National Parks can be as high as $35 each, so it ends up paying for itself after only a few visits. Definitely a Pathloom-recommended investment! 

Camping:

For camping at Pinnacles Campground, reservations are highly recommended as it is the only campground accessible by car within the National Park. There is no backcountry camping allowed within the park.

Itinerary:

Day 1: Bay Area to Pinnacles National Park

On a Friday afternoon, my friend and I set out from the Bay Area for Pinnacles National Park, the last remaining National Park I had yet to visit in the state of California. I’d driven by the park on multiple occasions, on trips to Big Sur, Southern California, and beyond - but had yet to explore what it had to offer. Due to limited camping options within the park, I had reserved a campsite ahead of time - the only location where camping is permitted. As such, reservations book up early, so it is recommended to begin planning well in advance if looking to camp here. 

We arrived at Pinnacles Campground, on the east side of the park, around dusk. It was about a 2.5-hour drive from my home in the East Bay. We quickly set up camp and applied some bug spray due to the onslaught of flies swarming us - a highly recommended inclusion to your pack if you are planning a visit!. Soon after our arrival, one of our neighbors caught our attention and pointed out a tree in the distance, indicating the presence of a Condor’s nest - it was a first for me to see a whole nest of these majestic birds roosting. Pinnacles is one of the few places in the world where this endangered species can regularly be spotted, adding to the appeal of this Park. Not too long after, we got a campfire going with the firewood we’d brought, and set in for a pleasant and relaxing evening.

We heard critters through the night, we guessed they were raccoons based on the fact we saw one right behind the campsite before going to sleep. On many occasions while camping throughout the Bay Area and surrounding regions, raccoons have always been a part of the mix. They can be quite cunning, sly, and aggressive all at the same time with one objective in mind - getting to your food. It’s important to practice proper food storage to prevent wildlife getting accustomed to getting food from campsites.

Day 2: Pinnacles National Park to Bay Area via Gazos Creek State Beach

The next morning, we woke up to the sun hitting our campsite - a terrific way to wake up in Springtime in California. During the summer, temperatures can get very hot, and thus shade at your campsite is a required respite from the heat. We set up a campfire to heat up some breakfast. After a good grub we hung out for a bit more at the site before packing up and departing the campground. 

We drove to the end of the road towards Moses Spring Trailhead find out more about what the Park had to offer, finding the drive itself and most areas of the park very crowded on a Saturday. Although Pinnacles is considered to be one of the most underrated parks in the state, it wasn’t surprising to see so many people as it was a weekend. After exploring the region for a bit, we found a picnic area for some quiet lunch before heading to the coast to catch the sunset.

Our picnic area was nestled along a flat open canyon. There was a good breeze flowing, and we brought out the goods for a tasty afternoon lunch. We took a mile-long walk along the canyon bed to digest the meal before eventually packing up and leaving the Park around mid-afternoon. 

My first impression of the park was that it felt more like a State Park in California than a National Park due to a few things: easy accessibility from an urban setting, the small size of the park itself, and the grouping of campsite clusters at one single campground. I enjoyed the terrain, flora, and fauna in the park - offering rock formations, caves, trees and other wildlife. I am looking forward to exploring the park more in the future via day hikes, which may be an easier way to beat the crowds on the trails and at the campsite.

Our plan from there was to visit Gazos Creek State Beach, one of my favorite stops to catch a sunset even though it is quite a ways away from the Park - it was about a 2-hour drive to the beach from Pinnacles. Gazos State Beach is a part of Ano Nuevo State Park near Pescadero, CA, which offers spectacular hikes on a coastal bluff setting. We arrived at the beach parking lot, quickly gathered our belongings, and walked out onto the sand.  

We found an open spot with great views of surrounding cliffs and the Pacific Ocean setting a perfect backdrop to the sunset. We soaked in every moment of the colorful sky as it turned from bright orange to purple to dusk. It was a perfect way to end a relaxing weekend getaway, and cross off the last National Park in California for me!

As my internship at Pathloom comes to a close, I have been thinking about the trip that inspired me to reach out to Pathloom a few months ago. My spontaneous road trip to all of the National Parks in the contiguous 48 states in 2021 deepened my love for the outdoors, and inspired me to write about some of my experiences to share with those who share that same passion. 

A combination of timing and COVID restrictions pushed me to explore the natural beauty within the States, rather than heading abroad to new countries to get my travel fix. We often forget how much geological diversity there is within the vast landscapes of the United States - from sand dunes to reefs, mountain ranges to islands, swamps to badlands. The ability to conquer all of these landscapes and meet people from every corner of the country was truly incredible. But rather than the accomplishment of hitting 51 National Parks in under 6 months, I am most proud of what I learned about myself along the journey.

#1: With Freedom, Comes Personal Responsibility

With the unwavering freedom of solo traveling comes the responsibility of taking care of yourself, car and plans. You are in the driver's seat of your life (literally), and in a position to make all of your own decisions. Everyday I practiced making smart decisions - such as storing food properly, making meals, finding a sleeping location, being responsible with my equipment and not taking any unnecessary risks. 

When I was in Sequoia National Park, I was planning to go to Yosemite the next day - but a huge snow storm was coming into the Sierra Nevada mountain range region. Reluctantly, I decided to avoid the weather and head almost 6 hours out of my way to the coast of California for a few days before going to Yosemite, which delayed my itinerary for nearly 3 days. As I arrived back on the east side of California and headed into a campground just outside of Yosemite, there was too much snow. I almost got my car stuck because the campground was unplowed. After calling the local plow service, I took their suggestion to return to a nearby town to purchase snow chains, find a new campground for the night and try again tomorrow.

#2: Appreciate The Little Things 

Find happiness in the simplest of things. Sunrises and sunsets were my favorite events of the day - and they are free! Some memorable sunset locations: Flathead Lake, MT, Page, AZ, White Sands National Park, NM, Destin, FL, Petrified Forest National Park, AZ, Lake Mead, NV, Voyageurs National Park, MI and just about anywhere on the West Coast. The most memorable sunrise of the trip was at Canyonlands National Park (where I snapped one of my favorite photos of the entire trip, see above). 

A simple campfire has always been one of my childhood favorite activities, but this trip changed the meaning of them to me. They became the signal of calm - the day was done, I am safely in a campground and there is an epic plan for tomorrow. As I was camping in Cuyahoga Valley National Park at Army Camp Road campground, the group in the site next to me was playing the guitar and singing each evening. I first thought it was a speaker, but I heard laughs and realized they were signing. I simply rolled down my window and listened to the incredible music as I fell asleep. 

Appreciating the small, trivial things each day made my journey so much sweeter and taught me to not take things for granted - even something as seemingly insignificant as a shower!

#3: Trust in Humanity

The solitude I found in the wilderness throughout my trip helped me reflect upon myself, but just about every person I met on the road reassured my belief that most people have good intentions. Each person I met along the way added a unique memory to my park experiences that I will hold in my heart forever. 

Bill, from the Grand Canyon who had been hiking there for decades, taught me about every small species in the canyon. I met Debi at Faria Campground outside of a full campground in Ventura, CA, and she let me pull my car into her camping spot for the night. Nick from Redwood National Park, chatted with me for hours on a hike about college, breaking norms, and exploring the West Coast. Lisa and Gordon, who I met on Angels Landing in Zion (a MUST do!), took photos and shared stories of their epic hiking experiences with me. I met Carla, another female solo traveler, in Colorado and we camped together for multiple nights in Rocky Mountain National Park, sharing college stories and future career goals. I met the sweetest old couple from Nevada in Theodore Roosevelt National Park that told me to “save for the future, but live for the present.” 

Everyone's story, big or small, made me look at my life from a new perspective. The people I met on my trip taught me to be kind, ask for help, always be willing to offer assistance, and to look at life as one big opportunity to do the simple things that make us happy.

#4: How To Deal With The Unexpected… alone

I ran into many problems over the course of this journey. My car was hit in a Buffalo Wild Wings parking lot, my camera lens shattered in Joshua Tree National Park, I was towed up a mountain by a sheriff on my way to Grand Teton National Park, due to snow, I needed 4 new tires in Wyoming, and my car got aggressively inspected by an overzealous ranger at the Hoover Dam security checkpoint - just to name a few. 

Looking back, my most evident unexpected challenge was while I was hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park. The night before my hike I specifically chose a popular, but difficult hike called the Best of Bear Lake Area Loop and Emerald Lake. The trail head parking lot fills almost every morning by 8am and I assumed, since this was such a popular loop, that I wouldn't need my Garmin GPS device or bear spray. Turns out… soon into the hike I found myself alone, 4 miles into the middle of black bear country. The trail was snow covered, and I spent so much time constantly trying to decipher between backcountry ski tracks and hiking tracks. I lost the trail too many times to count. Eventually I found myself on the wrong side of a slippery iced over cliff, where I was sure I would have to make it up and over the 300 ft rock face above me to find the trail again. I could hear coyotes howling on the ridge above, but I had no choice but to backtrack and find the trail that led to the top of the rock face. I then ran for the remaining 2 miles of snowy trail until I saw another hiker. 

The most personal growth happens when you are forced into challenging situations where you need to make decisions, trust your gut and - not to be dramatic - survive.

#5: Just Keep Moving 

One of the most important lessons I learned came from the second night on the road. That morning, I drove to Shenandoah National Park and conquered my first epic 12 mile hike - Old Rag. I pulled away from the park and settled for the night in a Walmart parking lot in Charlottesville, VA. I was scared of the parking lot, I had no idea how to cook dinner, I was hungry, I was thirsty, and I was fatigued from the hike and a poor sleep the night before. I broke down on the phone to pretty much any person who would answer my call. Friends told me I was only 6 hours from home and I should just turn around. My parents told me to go find a hotel and come home the next day. Maybe it was the fact I refused to fail, or the fact I had told everyone I had talked to in the past year that I was going to complete this epic trip that kept me going. 

Looking back now, refusing the opportunity to go home that night absolutely changed the course of my life. Sometimes your best option is to just move forward. I slept off my anxiety and drove to the next location in the morning, and it became addicting to just keep moving and putting more and more miles on the road. Just keep moving.

Honorable Mentions

Nothing is worse than a wet tent  

Everglades National Park brought me my first rain storm while camping in my tent. I can assure you that there is nothing worse than having a wet tent when you are living out of your car. Drying out and storing wet gear is bad for your gear… and just plain gross. 


Car camping can get cold… very cold. 

I woke up one 10 degree morning in the Grand Canyon to a frozen water bottle next to me. Soon after telling this story to my mother, she forced me to purchase a 12 volt car electric blanket - it might have been the best “gear” investment of my entire trip!

The desert is cold!

When the sun sets in White Sands National Park, the sand becomes absolutely freezing. I left my shoes in my car and I regretted it deeply on my 10 minute walk through the dunes, with the feeling of pins and needles all through my feet. 


Check on your crampons
 I was hiking the Mist Trail in Yosemite in March when I got to the top and realized that I lost the trail - and one of my crampons as well! I had climbed a steep sheet of ice on the way up, so there was no way I could make it down without it. I had to backtrack for an hour or so looking in the snow for my crampon, which I eventually found!

Overall, realizing we are all such a small part of a big world might have been the most humbling and significant lesson of the entire trip. The achievement of visiting so many National Parks in such a short time itself didn't change my life, but the memories from overcoming every single challenge (alone!) on the way to the achievement certainly did. If I can offer one piece of advice, I urge you to seize every opportunity to explore in the wild - you really never know what you might find out about yourself. I am certainly thankful I did!

"On March 1st, 2022, Yellowstone National Park will celebrate the 150th anniversary of its establishment. The creation of the first official National Park in the world initiated a commitment to conservancy and environmentalism that continues to exist (to some extent) today, throughout this country and across the globe. In an effort to account for past inconsistencies in recognizing the millenia-long Native American connection to the region, Park authorities are actively integrating tribal customs and recommendations to establish the most respectful way of paying tribute to this incredible area of the country."

"Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic curtailing travel plans in 2020 for an exorbitant number of people within the United States - and the difficulty of navigating various international travel restrictions - the National Park System saw an enormous increase in visitation in the 2021 calendar year. Big Bend surpassed half a million visitors for the first time in the Park’s history. Grand Teton set individual monthly and overall annual records at over 3.8 million visitors in 2021."

"Alternating between heavy breathing and ‘4:30am funny’ jokes, we made our way up the Colchuck Glacier moraine and finally got to the climb itself. As we racked up our climbing gear, we joked about how long it would take to climb the 2,000 foot granite face, most guessing between 6 to 12 hours... No one guessed thirty. "

"Due to limited time on the island during a day trip, hiking trails are moderate and relatively short. If you arrive at Prisoners Harbor, I recommend bringing your lunch and hiking the 4 mile round trip trail to Pelican Bay for a picnic. This trail gives consistent 360 degree stunning views and even a chance to see the small island foxes that inhabit the island - they are adorable!"

(published 2/28/2022)

"The evening I camped here, the sky filled with dark clouds by sundown - offering one of the most intense and fierce sunsets I’ve ever witnessed. It felt like a scene from the Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit - the way the light penetrated through the ominous clouds made one of the high mountains seem as if it was glowing lucid red. I had to ask myself if I was hallucinating or something, but realized that this was far too real. That scene set the bar, and will probably be what I compare other sunsets to for years to come. The lightning off in the distance only made the evening even more exhilarating."

Sometimes the most rewarding experiences are when you venture off the mainland! Extra planning is required to get to these most remote National Parks in the contiguous United States, but it pays off. Dry Tortugas in Florida, Channel Islands in California, and Isle Royale in Michigan are all island National Parks that are more than worth the visit. Because of the difficulty involved in accessing these parks, their beauty is often overlooked. 


Dry Tortugas National Park

How to get there

Dry Tortugas is accessible only by seaplane or ferry. The most popular way to access the park is with the Yankee Freedom National Park ferries, which leave from a terminal just minutes from downtown Key West. They offer both day trips (7am to 5:15pm) and overnight camping trip transportation. The ferry tickets range from $180 to $210 and include breakfast, lunch and park entrance fees. Be sure to bring extra snacks and water for the day after you depart the ferry. Yankee Freedom also has parking available, but vans and cars with roof racks should call ahead to locate a convenient separate parking lot with no height restrictions. Although the daytime tends to be hot, the return trips are often very windy and cold because of the sun setting, so be sure to pack accordingly!

Activities

The Ferry drops off at Garden Key, home of the Park's famed Fort Jefferson. The Park itself is 99% water, so while there are not any hiking opportunities outside of the fort itself, relaxing on the beach or snorkeling are perfect activities to experience all the Park has to offer. The Florida Keys are home to the third largest reef system in the world, notable for its marine life diversity due to its remote location. Several snorkelers even reported seeing barracuda while I was visiting!

Accommodations

The Florida Keys have very limited camping options. I stayed on Cow Key at Boyd’s Key West Campground, which is a 20 min drive from the ferry terminal. The campground is right on the water, and very high-end... for a campsite! It included showers, water and night security. Because of the high price, I would not stay there again, but it worked in a pinch with minimal alternate options.  

Camping on Garden Key within Dry Tortugas is common for the more adventurous types, and is a great way to explore the park without groups of tourists nearby. The sites are all first-come, first-serve only, excluding group sites. It is required to take a ferry, rather than a seaplane to camp on the island. All campers will be guaranteed a campsite upon arrival. 

While you're in southern Florida, stop by Everglades and Biscayne National Parks too!

 
Channel Islands National Park

How to get there

Channel Islands National Park is comprised of 5 separate islands and the surrounding mile of ocean, only accessible by Island Packers ferries or via private boat. The ferries leave from Ventura or Oxnard harbors, and are both about a 2 hour round-trip boat ride. I took the ferry from Ventura Harbor to Prisoners Harbor on Santa Cruz Island. The ferry leaves at 9am and begins the return journey at 2:45pm. The day goes by fast, so make a plan before departure to know what activities you want to do to maximize your time on the beautiful island.

Activities 
 Due to limited time on the island during a day trip, hiking trails are moderate and relatively short. If you arrive at Prisoners Harbor, I recommend bringing your lunch and hiking the 4 mile round trip trail to Pelican Bay for a picnic. This trail gives consistent 360 degree stunning views and even a chance to see the small island foxes that inhabit the island - they are adorable!

Accommodations

While visiting Channel Islands, I stayed in Ventura on the coast of California at Faria Campground. This was one of the most beautiful campgrounds I have ever stayed at, right on the water. The campground is about a 15 minute drive to Ventura Harbor. There are many locals that frequent here, and it truly feels like a community. There are water and showers available for campers too. I even met some Volkswagen obsessed friends here - Ron and Mike, who showed me around the campground and shared a campfire with me! Although this campground was incredible, I would recommend getting reservations to camp on one of the islands for $15 per night for those who prefer solitude. The National Park Service offers camping on all 5 islands year round, that have been known to provide epic sunsets and chances for stargazing. This rare opportunity is an amazing way to experience the Park on your own, without crowds or tour groups passing by. 

If you are in need of new gear, Ventura is also home to Patagonia’s HQ and flagship store!

 
Isle Royale National Park

How to get there

Michigan is home to Isle Royale, one of my personal top 3 favorite National Parks, and the least visited National Park in the contiguous United States due to its secluded nature. As with Dry Tortugas, the island is only accessible via ferry or seaplane. Due to COVID restrictions and lack of planning on my part, ferry availability was slim when I arrived in Michigan, and therefore I took a seaplane to the island. I traveled with Isle Royale Seaplanes from Hancock Portage Canal to Rock Harbor. Although this alternative was more expensive, it was a more convenient and much faster way to access the park - and I got to experience my first seaplane ride! Travel time is about 40 minutes via seaplane, or 6 hours via Ranger III ferry from Houghton, MI to Rock Harbor. Be sure to plan ahead, because this park is closed annually from November 1st to April 15th!

Activities 

During my seaplane ride I met Jenny and Celeste, sisters from Maine, with whom I was fortunate enough to hike Stoll Memorial Trail. I spent most of my journey to 51 National Parks hiking alone, so it is always nice to share a few trail miles with some company. This moderate 4.2 mile trail starts from Rock Harbor and quickly navigates into desolate, wild land as you immerse yourself deeper into the island habitat. You travel through forests and along the island's shoreline, with stunning views the entire way. Before boarding the seaplane again, relax on the dock and listen to the loons calling in the background. If you're lucky, you might even spot a moose on the island!

Accommodations

While visiting the northern peninsula of Michigan, I camped at Hancock Recreation Area Campground. It had bathrooms, water and was conveniently located - only an 8 minute drive from the seaplane departure location. I did not make reservations since it was a large recreation area, and many camping spots were available when I showed up in the late afternoon. As with the other two parks on this list, there are also options to backpack, basecamp, boat or lodge on the island itself. There are 36 campgrounds located across the 40 mile long island, each of which require permits to stay overnight. 


 Avoiding the crowds at popular Parks and venturing beyond the beaten path is a great way to experience nature in its wildest form. Existing on an island provides a natural barrier for these Parks from direct human impact on their wild ecosystems. In general, these parks provide an alternative to the most popular National Parks and showcase plants and animals in a unique environment.

Life Lessons From Climbing Dragontail Peak
Self-Realization, Trials and Tribulations, and Lessons in Leadership Learned in Leavenworth, Washington

Colchuck lake and Dragontail Peak in the early morning. This is one of the most popular hikes in the Leavenworth area, and a must see when the Larches change color. Larches are one of only a few types of pine trees that drop their needles, turning bright gold before yielding to the winter cold.

 Guest Blogger Knight Campbell and his team at Cairn Leadership Strategies take business professionals on weekend long outdoor adventures designed as a catalyst for leadership and personal growth. They fuse an MBA level leadership curriculum with chances to test out theory in real life and time spent exploring ideas around the campfire with other leaders.

Surmounting the insurmountable on Dragontail Peak - Leavenworth, WA


We struck out at 4am, an ‘alpine start’ to get to the base of Serpentine Arete just before dawn. Somehow, the ascent to Colchuck Lake flew by in the dark, as if not seeing things makes them easier. Alternating between heavy breathing and ‘4:30am funny’ jokes, we made our way up the Colchuck Glacier moraine and finally got to the climb itself. As we racked up our climbing gear, we joked about how long it would take to climb the 2,000 foot granite face, most guessing between 6 to 12 hours... No one guessed thirty. 

I have been climbing mountains for almost twenty years now, and I can honestly say all of the most important lessons in my life have come from time spent in the wilderness. This particular adventure slowly but surely transformed from a challenging undertaking to an epic. It encapsulated many of the key lessons that the mountains have whispered into my ears over the years. I share them here with you for fun and to plant seeds, but to truly learn these lessons you will have to experience them on your own adventures - and if you are lucky, your own epics!

11 miles and 6,000 feet of elevation gain is serious, but should not take 30 hours!


When does it become an epic?

Epics are somewhat in the eye of the beholder. In my experience, anything can become an epic with a few key ingredients. Take any old foray into the unknown: mix in a little of the unexpected, take out a few of the tools you wish you had, throw in a dash of overconfidence, and then add about 20 hours to your expected completion time. Voila - an epic. 

At the top we are all smiles, but getting to the top is only half of the journey!


Lesson 1: It’s always easier than it looks

A funny thing about perspective and mountains is that they almost always look impossible to surmount from the bottom. What is actually a thirty degree slope or a maze of easily accessible goat trails looks like an impenetrable fortress. I almost turned around when I saw the cables up Half Dome in Yosemite for the first time. For the record it is a steep walk up with secure cables to hold onto - strenuous, but nothing to run from. Over the years I have learned that pressing on despite the fear instilled by a seemingly impenetrable rock face almost always results in a great day. When it looks impossible, go a little further!

Long ways to go at Dragontail Peak: Leavenworth, WA


Lesson 2: It’s always harder than you thought it would be

So I am embarrassed to say I got lost on the first pitch of Serpentine Arete. I found myself run out (not enough protection below me) in a mossy crack ten minutes into our climb! This foreshadowed a full 12 hours of small missteps, staring up wondering where the route might go, and debating which gully was “the gully with a sandy ledge.” We had some amazing pitches of climbing, and others ended up being chossy - leaving us tiptoeing as we tried not to knock rocks off onto each other. We finally topped out the climb that should have taken only six hours, just in time to enjoy a gorgeous sunset. 

The number of times I have been suckered in by a false summit, gone with less food or water than I needed because I assumed the climb would be easy, or been blindsided by unanticipated complications in the mountains is staggering. Here’s what happens with complacency. We carry extra first aid supplies for a while, and then not needing them for a year or two we take them out of our bags, item by item, until we have a major injury and no first aid kit left to handle it. It’s almost always more difficult than anticipated, so hope for the best but plan for the worst.  

Not a bad view from Dragontail Peak: Leavenworth, WA


Lesson 3: Demonstrate Hope  

After a full value day, we felt confident that we could get back to the car by 2am- a mere 24 hours after we began. We merrily tromped our way down to the notch that leads to Aasgard Pass. We turned the corner, and came across a treacherous snow field but we had prepared for this (see lesson two). We took out our heavy crampons and axes and headed onto the narrow band of snow between us and a jovial hike down. Then we found a 50 foot wide section of blue ice - which our team could not safely cross without the right anchors or experience. Fighting the temptation to despair, we fumbled through many plans of sending one person over to set a fixed line and towing gear back; to rappelling off cliffs behind us and hoping for the best. After much deliberation, we found a small gully that went down the side of the glacier. We tied our ropes together and made the awkward rappel down to the dirt below the glacier. We finally all cleared the rappel around midnight, and let me tell you, we looked haggard. 

This was the hardest part for me. I am fairly resilient and I can take a few unanticipated issues like poor route finding, slow climbing, or the wrong gear. But at some point, “Fatigue makes cowards of us all,” or so said General Patton in WWII. As a team, it would have been easy to feel betrayed by the mountain. Simple to give up hope. I wanted to sit down and cry when we found out we would need to spend the next three hours rappelling. That’s the moment teams and leaders have to be vigilant. A smile, a joke, a pat on the back - all these actions can mean the difference between finding a way out and a dangerous state of depression or apathy. Know it’s going to get harder, and demonstrate faith that your team will find a way. If you give up hope as a leader, hope is lost for everyone. 

Dragontail After Dark: Leavenworth, WA


Lesson 4: You have more in the tank than you think… 
...as long as you don’t complain

We made it about an hour down the treacherous slabs and cliffs that followed until we agreed that continuing only increased the likelihood of slipping or making a poor decision due to fatigue. We crumpled onto our packs, shivering in the cold night wind, and snoozed for an hour before someone said “I have to move.” All of us were happy to hear this, as we had all been thinking the same for at least the past half hour. We spent the next seven hours making our way down Aasgard Pass, and back out the Colchuck trail. On the way down excited hikers inquired “did you make it to the lake?” We chuckled, yes, we did (yesterday). 
All said, we were moving for about thirty hours in mostly difficult and often dangerous terrain. We were thirsty, tired, sore, and happy. I never tire of type II fun, the type of fun that is perhaps more fun to fondly remember over cold drinks than to experience in the moment. It makes me feel alive and reminds me that with a good team, a good attitude, and some of the right gear I am capable of far more than I expected. You can do more than you think, unless you complain. 

Nearing the top of Dragontail Peak: Leavenworth, WA


It’s about the journey

I loved every minute of this epic adventure (ok, most of them - there was a dark moment in there when we were up against the blue ice). I used to climb mountains to prove to myself how cool I was. A mountaineering attempt without a summit was a waste of time. Somewhere along the way I realized that 10 minutes of happiness on the top for 24 hours of misery throughout the rest of the trek was not a smart deal. Now I love the challenge of it all. I savor the chance to test, and perhaps even strengthen my resilience. I cherish the time spent with other people who love the wilderness as much as me, and I truly love taking business leaders on these trips to help them realize that the summit isn’t what matters. It’s always the journey itself. 

Leavenworth, WA is world-renown as one of the best climbing areas on the planet

National Park Service Commemorates Black History Month

In honor of Black History Month 2022, the National Park Service has arranged multiple events, both online and in-person, to celebrate the immense impact African Americans have had on our country's history as a whole and on outdoor preservation and conservation efforts in particular. Learn about Black History Month programs throughout the month, African American Heritage Parks, the African American Civil Rights Network, and more. The NPS has also recently created an interactive story map utilizing GIS software that allows users to explore the rich tradition of historical sites throughout the country.

Record Setting Year for National Park Visitation in 2021

Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic curtailing travel plans in 2020 for an exorbitant number of people within the United States - and the difficulty of navigating various international travel restrictions - the National Park System saw an enormous increase in visitation in the 2021 calendar year. Big Bend surpassed half a million visitors for the first time in the Park’s history. Grand Teton set individual monthly and overall annual records at over 3.8 million visitors in 2021. Throughout the country, National Parks set records for attendance - which unfortunately also exposed limitations in outdated park infrastructure ill-equipped to handle the influx of additional tourists. While park officials work to update their capabilities to take on an uptick that they expect to continue into the future, websites such as this one will continue to do what we can to identify less-traversed trails within the Parks, or nearby State Park alternatives, that may provide an equally fulfilling yet less crowded experience.

Rocky Mountain National Park Extends Timed Entry Reservation System into 2022, Introduces Backpacking Permit System

Again due to the influx in visitors throughout 2021, Rocky Mountain National Park has plans to maintain a timed-entry reservation system for access to the Park initially implemented in 2021. Visitors can sign up in advance to select a 2-hour entrance window on their desired date when they will be permitted entry to the park. This is designed to reduce drain on Park resources, alleviate traffic burdens on Park roads, and provide for a better overall experience for all. 

The Park also announced the implementation of a 100% online-only overnight backpacking wilderness permit system via Recreation.gov. The system is designed to reduce overcrowding, enforce Leave No Trace regulations, and ensure visitors are properly educated on safety concerns such as bears or mountain weather.

USS Constitution Appoints First Woman as Commanding Officer in 224-year History

In a historical (and long-overdue) change-of-command ceremony in January, Commander Billie Farrel was officially appointed the Commanding Officer of the USS Constitution, a 224-year old battleship that serves as one of the crown jewels of Boston National Historical Park. The ship is nicknamed “Old Ironsides” for being seemingly impervious to cannon fire throughout dozens of expeditions, dating back to its initial commission in 1797. Farrell’s appointment is well-deserved, as prior to serving on the ship’s crew she has a decorated naval history, including a stint as Executive Officer of the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Vicksburg. Old Ironsides may not see the same level of action these days as it has in the past, but still serves an important educational role for this country’s naval heritage.

Happy Birthday, Yellowstone National Park

On March 1st, 2022, Yellowstone National Park will celebrate the 150th anniversary of its establishment. The creation of the first official National Park in the world initiated a commitment to conservancy and environmentalism that continues to exist (to some extent) today, throughout this country and across the globe. In an effort to account for past inconsistencies in recognizing the millenia-long Native American connection to the region, Park authorities are actively integrating tribal customs and recommendations to establish the most respectful way of paying tribute to this incredible area of the country. As Covid-19 restrictions have had a serious impact on the planning of in-person celebratory events, it is recommended to check this website on a regular basis as news develops.

(published 1/3/2022)

"Astronomical Conjunctions occur when two astronomical objects - such as planets, stars, moons, or the sun - align in the sky, creating an illusion that they are close together when in reality they are thousands of miles apart. The objects are bright, so you’ll be able to see them with the naked eye, but with binoculars or a telescope, you can view amazing details - such as the rings of Saturn, or the moons surrounding these planets!"

"The massive KNP Complex Wildfire that raged in Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks has finally reached full containment after months of devastation and the destruction of up to 5% of the world's population of Giant Sequoia trees. Even though there may be traces of the blaze that still smolder, officials are now confident that there will be no additional spread thanks to the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The fire, caused by lightning strikes during a period of climate change-amplified drought, burnt 88,000 acres over the span of 3 months and caused many local towns to be emergency evacuated."

"Your gut feeling is always right. If you have a funny feeling about something - trust it. When you're traveling through extraordinary places it can be hard to pass up experiences. But, not pushing the limits on safety and taking a step back, when I encountered things such as unwanted animal prints, snowy roads, icy trails and dinner invitations from strangers proved to keep me safe throughout my journey."

"So in early 2021 I took a semester off, packed my car with camping gear and set off for a solo adventure to all of the National Parks within the contiguous United States. Along my journey to these 51 Parks, I traveled through 45 states. Since National Parks were my main focus, I decided to leave another of my goals, to visit all 50 states, for another trip. Last year’s epic trip will be hard to top in 2022, but I know that life is unpredictable and the perfect time to do anything will never come if you keep waiting - you just have to make it happen!"

Overview:

In mid-May of 2021, I embarked on a journey from the Bay Area in California to Boulder, Colorado, for the Moosejaw Outdoor Accelerator program. Like any outdoors enthusiast with a travel bug and a good vehicle, I decided to make the most of it by making it a camping road trip instead of flying direct. I drove through California, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah; finally reaching Colorado on the third day. For sleeping arrangements, I opted for dispersed camping in Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and National Forest areas for both nights. I spent most of my time driving through amazing scenery on this trip, especially appreciating the sections where I was driving through back roads and single-lane highways away from the busy interstate system. 

On the first day, I drove all the way from the Bay to Arizona without stopping much, reaching the Virgin River Gorge area right around sunset. Within a half hour of exploring on BLM dirt roads, I found a dispersed campsite that I really liked. It had majestic views of the surrounding canyons and buttes peppered with Joshua trees all around. 

On the second day, I drove out in the morning and headed for Utah. The drive was scenic, curving through National Forest areas, and there was still snow to be found at some of the higher elevation regions. I eventually arrived at a National Forest area right outside Bryce Canyon National Park. I found a spot to have a quick lunch before exploring the area for a couple of hours. For my second campsite in the trip, I ended up coming back to my lunch spot as it was nicely spaced, flat, and had amazing views of the canyon right before me. 

On the third day, I woke up before sunrise and drove to the highest point in Bryce Canyon for an epic sunrise view. I hiked around the area for a couple of hours, before eventually returning to my car to make my way towards Capitol Reef National Park. Once at Capitol Reef, I did a few small hikes/walks to explore the rock layers and canyons, and drove around on a few dirt roads to explore even more canyons. Around late afternoon, I started my drive to Colorado, eventually reaching my destination, Boulder, around 10 pm.

Trip Planning:

Permits:

For National Parks, I had previously purchased the ”American the Beautiful” National Parks pass which permitted me entry into Bryce Canyon and Capitol Reef. The pass, which is valid for a year, is well worth the $80 if you plan to travel to at least 3 parks over that span. As the entry fee for most National Parks can be as high as $35 each, the pass ends up paying for itself after only a few visits. Definitely a Pathloom-recommended investment! 

Camping:

For both nights of camping, I opted for dispersed sites. Dispersed camping is on a first-come, first-serve basis, hence not requiring any reservations - nor any fees to pay. Both the Virgin River Gorge BLM and Dixie National Forest areas where I camped had plenty of options. There were quite a few occupied campsites, but the further I drove in, the fewer people I saw.

Itinerary:

Day 1: Bay Area, CA to Virgin River Gorge, AZ

I drove out in the morning from the Bay Area. I passed through Bakersfield and Las Vegas, eventually reaching the Virgin River Gorge area in Arizona. I got into the area right before sunset and drove on BLM roads for a few more miles until stumbling upon an open campsite nestled among Joshua trees, where I set up camp for the evening. The views from the site were spectacular, especially the sunset reflecting golden hues off the canyons. Once I settled in, I set up my tent and started collecting some downed logs and branches for a campfire. After enjoying a fire and some stargazing, I checked into my tent for a good night of rest.

Day 2: Virgin River Gorge, AZ to Bryce Canyon, UT

I woke up the next morning surrounded by Joshua trees in every direction. Seeing the area for the first time during the daytime reminded me of some areas I’ve been to in Death Valley National Park - the rocky desert feel with trees, mountains, and canyons creating an extraterrestrial-like setting. I had a quick breakfast, packed up my tent, and embarked on the drive to Bryce. Along the way, I stopped at some places in Dixie National Forest - the mountain and forest views were quite relaxing. I eventually made it to the Bryce Canyon area, and drove to Tom’s Best Spring Road (part of Dixie) in search of my next campsite. 

After driving for less than a mile down dirt roads, I ended up at a fairly large campsite area which was right at the edge of a canyon. I had some lunch there and decided to continue exploring to try to find a campsite further away from the main road -  perhaps with even better views than what I already had at this site. I managed to stumble across a couple of even more epic sites, but they were already occupied by other campers. After driving around for an hour without finding anything overly promising, I decided to turn back and head to the campsite where I had lunch. Once I made it back to the original campsite, to my delight it was still available, so I started setting up camp. 

It was still fairly early in the afternoon, so once I had camp all set up, I took a stroll around the area. The canyon was stunning, I don’t think I’d ever camped next to a setting such as this before. After spending a few hours exploring, I headed back to camp to take a small nap before heading back out to collect some downed branches and logs for an evening campfire. I relaxed into the evening, ate some dinner, and eventually called it a night around 9pm.

Day 3: Bryce Canyon, UT to Boulder, CO via Capitol Reef National Park

On the third day, I woke up a few hours before sunrise, packed up camp in the dark, and made my way back to Highway 12 towards Bryce Canyon National Park. I wanted to catch the sunrise from the highest point in the park. Surprisingly (or not so surprisingly), I wasn’t the only one on such a mission that day - others had similar intentions and there were a few cars pacing me as I made my way up the canyon. Once in the National Park, I drove to the end of the road at Rainbow Point overlook - sitting at 9,115 ft. As the sun came up over the mountains in the distance, the entire canyon valley started to show color and almost made me feel like I had somehow been transported to Mars. I took my time basking in the sunrise before driving back down the canyon, stopping at various viewpoints along the way to enjoy more of what the park had to offer. I took a stroll along Bryce Point overlook, which offered what might have been the best views in the entire park. I spent a bit more time taking in some more sights, then eventually made my way out of Bryce Canyon and headed towards Capitol Reef.

After stopping for some gas, I made it into Capitol Reef National Park, and it was quite the dramatic entrance, to say the least - the views were simply breathtaking! After taking a few minutes to get my bearings on the map, I decided to go off-roading to Pleasant Creek, a much-needed respite from the crowds I had already encountered on the paved areas of the park. Pleasant Creek was amazing and offered quite a remote feeling - I only saw one other car throughout this entire excursion. I took plenty of time to explore the area - dipping my feet into the creek itself was especially rejuvenating! Eventually, I made it back on the pavement and embarked on another off-road trail for Capitol Gorge. Unlike Pleasant Creek, this ‘road’ was packed with two-way traffic of Sprinters and SUVs. After taking in some vistas and exploring more viewpoints in the park on foot, I said goodbye to Capitol Reef and embarked on the final stretch of my trip to my hotel room in Boulder, CO. I stopped in Vail for a quick break as dusk was setting in to catch a beautiful mountain sunset, and finally reached Boulder around 10 pm. Overall, I couldn’t have asked for a better start to my 2 months in Colorado!

10 Great Safety Tips for Solo Road Trips
How to Stay Safe When Traveling Alone - In Car and at Campsite

Pat Tillman Bridge: Hoover Dam. Boulder City, NV - Photo Credit: Bryan Donoghue 


Traveling alone, especially as a female, can seem like a rather daunting feat. Horrific stories can sometimes prevent us from going on adventures just because we are afraid to go by ourselves. On January 1st, 2021 I left on a 6 month journey to visit each and every one of the National Parks within the contiguous United States...alone. I was hesitant at first, but since none of my friends were interested in going cross-country while living in a car, the only way I was going to check this trip off my bucket list was to go by myself! Over the course of this journey, I learned to love the freedom that solo travel gave me. 

Before and during my trip across the country, the most frequently made comment people said to me was “Wow, you are going alone?!” I assured them (and often myself!) that yes I was indeed going alone, and I would be just fine. Along my journey, safety was paramount and I quickly made several rules to live by - sure some may seem obvious, and not all are necessarily backed up by empirical science - but it doesn't mean they aren't important, and it doesn't mean they can't help! Although my trip was solo, these tips generally apply to road trips where friends tag along as well!

Be vague with strangers! 

Traveling is all about meeting new, awesome people -  on the road or on the trail. However, be sure to keep it vague if someone asks you about the specifics of your plans, or where you are setting up camp for the night. I often told people I was meeting up with friends later (since it was pretty obvious I was alone) or was expecting to leave the area that day. 


Look for other solo travelers!

Camp together, hike together, keep each other safe. This one might take some practice and some trust, but I met some amazing women out on the road that I still keep in touch with to this day. If you spot another fellow solo traveler - introduce yourself! They often have great stories, and usually would love to share a campfire or morning coffee. 


Camp next to families! 

The last thing you'd likely want to do on your camping trip in the solitude of the wilderness is to camp next to noisy kids, but if you roll into a campground late at night or just feel not so safe in a particular area - find a family or group and camp close to them. I did this a few times when I stopped for the night in campgrounds right outside of large cities, where I was camping for convenience rather than leisure. I think of kids as generally a sign of safety and I've found that parents tend to be more apt to help people in need, especially a young female. I also feel like it is less likely for something to happen to me when there is a larger group of people around.

Be aware!

This might be the most painfully obvious one on the list, but when you pull into a new area - this is the time to make judgments. See who's around you, and see what the area is like. Be aware of your surroundings at all times, and be sure to look out for any posted warnings. For example, when I pulled into my Rocky Mountain National Park campsite I was greeted with a sign that said there had been black bear activity at my site, so I made sure to use the bear box that was provided and store my food and garbage properly. 


Make camp before dark!

Setting up your campsite before the sun sets can allow you time to survey the area and maybe see if there is someone camping off in the distance - or search for unwanted animal tracks in your vicinity. I felt more comfortable sleeping with no one around me when I was in remote locations. So, if I arrived and someone was camping in the area, I would just be extra aware of who it is and their actions as I was making camp for the night. If there are animal tracks - be sure to store food properly. Apart from these benefits - this is just good planning in general. It is far easier to set up your tent, cook, and do dishes while not holding a flashlight! 


Share your location with a trusted friend/family member!

Oftentimes when out in the wilderness you can find yourself with just enough service to make a phone call, but not use the internet. When this happens, if you've already shared your location with friends/family back home, you can call them and have them help you search for a campsite, grocery store, gas station, etc. This is especially helpful because it can be difficult to describe exactly where you are if you're in the middle of a park somewhere.

Carry a Satellite Communicator!

Losing cell phone service when heading out “off the grid” can be a true sign you're deep in the wilderness. Oftentimes, the best trails and campsites don't have any sort of service. My Garmin inReach device went everywhere with me, and was my lifeline if I ever needed help on my trip and didn't have reception with my phone. I used my Garmin whenever I arrived at a location where I intended to stay for the night that didn’t have phone coverage. When I arrived at my campground in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, I was able to shoot a preset message to my parents that said “I am OK. Staying here for the night” - which would be sent directly to their cell phones along with the GPS coordinates of my location. I also used it to lay tracking points every 10 minutes on my longer hikes in case I lost the trail and needed to backtrack or call for help. 


Camp under lights!

Sometimes open campgrounds are nowhere to be found,  and you end up needing to sleep in your car in a parking lot. I usually opted for a Walmart or Cabelas parking lot and fortunately never personally had any bad experiences. Although both stores don’t have a very clear policy on overnight camping and length of stay, I always made a quick phone call or visit to the customer service desk inside to ask. I never had any employee tell me I couldn't stay. and sometimes I even had managers tell me I could camp regardless of the "no camping" signs in the parking lot - It never hurts to ask! I always parked under a light, and finding a light post with a security camera was a bonus. Although it can be tempting to park in the dark corner for a good night's sleep without being bothered, a well-lit area can help to deter unwanted visitors.

Pepper spray and/or alarm!

The goal of course is to never need to use them, but having both pepper spray and some sort of a handheld alarm can make you feel safer, and give you a first line of defense if needed. I carried pepper spray EVERYWHERE I went. I never carried a personal alarm, but I slept with my keys right next to me during the night to be able to sound my car alarm if I needed help during the night. 


Trust your instincts! 

The most important one for last. Your gut feeling is always right. If you have a funny feeling about something - trust it. When you're traveling through extraordinary places it can be hard to pass up experiences. But, not pushing the limits on safety and taking a step back, when I encountered things such as unwanted animal prints, snowy roads, icy trails and dinner invitations from strangers proved to keep me safe throughout my journey.

National Park Fee-Free Days Announced for 2022

Each year, the National Park Service selects several dates throughout the year in which they waive entrance fees for all National Parks across the country. This presents an excellent opportunity for nature lovers from all economic backgrounds to experience the wonders of the American National Park System. Plan to arrive as early in the day as possible though, as these will understandably be some of the busiest days of the year to visit. Fee-free dates are as follows:
Monday, January 17 – Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 
Saturday, April 16 – First Day of  National Park Week 
Thursday, August 4 – Anniversary of the Great American Outdoors Act 
Saturday, September 24 – National Public Lands Day 
Friday, November 11 – Veterans Day 
Entrance fees for parks on days other than those listed above can be as high as $35 per vehicle, so if you are unable to visit on any of the dates listed below you may want to consider investing $80 in the America The Beautiful Pass, which allows you to visit every Park in the country as often as you'd like over the course of the entire year.

Prescribed Fires to Begin at Several National Parks in January

Throughout January 2022, several National Parks throughout the country will begin a series of prescribed burns that may interfere with visitation plans while active. Planned fires such as these are essential to reduce the amount of hazardous fuel found throughout these parks, which if left alone could exponentially increase the risk of wildfire spread during the dry season. These burns are carefully performed with the safety of staff and visitors at the forefront of consideration. 

Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon National Parks, and Valles Caldera National Preserve are among the National Park Service administered areas that will be impacted by this burn program, so be sure to check official Park websites when planning any travel to ensure your plans will not be impacted - especially if you or anyone in your party is sensitive to smoke inhalation.

KNP Complex Wildfire Reaches 100% Containment

The massive KNP Complex Wildfire that raged in Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks has finally reached full containment after months of devastation and the destruction of up to 5% of the world's population of Giant Sequoia trees. Even though there may be traces of the blaze that still smolder, officials are now confident that there will be no additional spread thanks to the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The fire, caused by lightning strikes during a period of climate change-amplified drought, burnt 88,000 acres over the span of 3 months and caused many local towns to be emergency evacuated. Though the fire is officially contained, there are many areas throughout these Parks that remain closed so as always, be sure to check the Park website when planning a visit.

Cape Lookout National Seashore Certified as Int'l Dark Sky Park

Cape Lookout National Seashore, off the coast of North Carolina, has been dedicated as the first International Dark Sky Park on the Atlantic Seaboard. This designation means the area is far enough from sources of light pollution that it presents an ideal environment for stargazing and other lunar events - a rare circumstance on the otherwise crowded East Coast. The majority of Dark Sky Parks are located in extremely remote areas throughout the country, so this certification is especially impressive and informs those dwelling on the East Coast of an incredible opportunity to see the night sky without needing to travel to the opposite side of the country.

"As winter approaches and temperatures throughout much of the country begin to drop, many of us are searching for ways to enjoy the outdoors without being impacted by the cold. Three National Parks in particular are epic year-round destinations due to their constant temperature: Mammoth Cave, Wind Cave and Carlsbad Caverns National Parks all include very diverse landscapes on the surface, but their main attraction is underground. These three unique parks all incorporate caves that hold deep geologic and human history from thousands of years ago."

"Camping in cold weather is truly something special, it’s pure winter peacefulness. To make sure that you’re ready for your next winter campout, you must count on your fair-weather camping skills, and adapt to the new challenges snowy landscapes and cold temperatures will bring. Winter camping is indeed an entirely different animal than fair-weather camping, but you’re still going to need to apply the skills you’ve gained camping during the summer months."

"Beginning April 1, 2022, any visitors to Zion National Park in Southwestern Utah who plan to hike the iconic Angels Landing trail will require a permit to do so. Those permits will be allotted via lottery system at Recreation.gov, with the first lottery opening on January 3, 2022. Information on how to register for this and future lotteries can be found here."

"Cold-weather camping is an unparalleled experience, provided you do some research, plan carefully, and pack smartly. The correct sleeping bag, pad, tent and clothing, along with some miscellaneous items will have you prepared for an unforgettable late-winter excursion. Keep in mind that this is not a complete checklist of backpacking and camping gear, but rather the essentials you need on top of your fair-weather kit to make a winter camping trip in the backcountry successful."

Whether you’re an avid sky watcher or or just head out to catch the occasional meteor shower, there is a good chance you heard about 2020's especially vivid “Christmas Star”, the Jupiter and Saturn’s Great Conjunction on December 21st. The event made national news as the two planets hadn't been this visible from Earth since the year 1623. What few people know is that planetary conjunctions are fairly common between other planets and astronomical objects. They may not all be worthy of the title of “Great”, but these events are quite interesting regardless. You’ll be able to see two or more of these stunning astronomical objects — most of which are not usually visible to the naked eye — and their orbits will be so close together that they’ll appear within the same lens of a telescope! Want to know more? Pathloom’s Official Guide to Planet Conjunctions is here for everything you need to know about these astronomical wonders!

Editor's note, this article is an update to last year's Guide to Planetary Conjunctions, with new information for 2022. The article was originally written by Pathloom intern Justine Imburgio, and she included so much useful information that we wanted to keep everything as intact as possible for this updated edition. Read on for information about what Planetary Conjunctions are, and how best to view and/or photograph them. 

Or, Scroll down to the bottom of this page (or click here) for a list of planetary conjunctions occurring throughout the remainder of the 2022 Calendar Year!

What are Planetary Conjunctions?

Astronomical Conjunctions occur when two astronomical objects - such as planets, stars, moons, or the sun - align in the sky, creating an illusion that they are close together when in reality they are thousands of miles apart. The objects are bright, so you’ll be able to see them with the naked eye, but with binoculars or a telescope, you can view amazing details - such as the rings of Saturn, or the moons surrounding these planets!

How to View Planetary Conjunctions

Viewing planetary conjunctions is easy, but it does require a bit of planning. First, know when to arrive at your location. These events often occur all day and night, but they’re typically most visible about 45 minutes after sunset. Be aware of the sun’s afterglow, however, which may wash out the view. If this happens, you may have to wait a little longer to see anything.

Also, be mindful of the placement of the objects in the sky. It’d be disappointing to go out of your way to see an astronomical wonder that is hidden behind trees from your viewpoint because it’s lower in elevation than you expected! The ideal viewing locations have a horizon that is as clear as possible, such as open fields and beaches. If these flat areas aren’t available to you, look for high vantage points like balconies, hills, or anywhere else that can provide an elevated view of the horizon. When you get there, apps such as Star Walk 2 are a great help to ensure that you’re looking in the right direction. This app maps out the entire sky so you can view the locations of planets, constellations, and moons in real time, directly through your phone. 

If you live in an urban area, you’re going to want to find somewhere with as little light pollution as possible. Luckily, you won’t have to go as far as you’d necessarily think. The suburbs just outside your city often work well enough, depending on the brightness of the planets. I was able to see the Great Conjunction last December just while driving around in the suburbs outside Philadelphia! Alternatively, if you’re feeling adventurous, use the conjunction as an excuse to go camping, or take a night hike into the wilderness for optimal viewing conditions.

The one factor you won’t be able to plan for, but arguably the most important, is the presence of a clear sky. Planets are seen best without overcast clouding your experience, so try to avoid nights that will definitely be rainy or foggy. Planetary conjunctions also vary in brightness so they might not as easily visible at first - but don’t lose hope! Many of these events last for several days, so you may be able to try again the following day when viewing conditions have improved. Although rare, some conjunctions are even bright enough to be visible in the daytime!

Photographing Planetary Conjunctions

If you like to take pictures, you may want to try your hand at photographing the planetary conjunctions you see. Astronomical objects photograph best in dark skies with little light pollution surrounding it, but they can sometimes come through in front of colorful sunsets. Staying out long enough to capture your planets in both sunset and night sky settings can make for some very interesting shots! If you do go with the dark sky option but want your planets to come off as brighter, see if your phone has a “night mode”. This will stabilize long exposure and make your darks look darker, providing a better contrast to the stars and planets . If using a DSLR camera, you can stabilize this exposure manually by using a tripod to get a sharper image. You can further sharpen your image by utilizing the Manual Focus mode. Finally, experiment with different lenses. A wide lens will allow you to capture more of the foreground and scenery of your viewing location, while a telephoto lens will give you a clearer, zoomed in shot. Capturing these events can be a challenging, but extremely rewarding experience!

Pathloom Picks: Best Campsites of 2021
Our annual staff picks for our favorite campsites visited this year
Moonrise over Loon Lake: Eldorado National Forest, CA - Photo Credit: Bryan Donoghue
 
Happy Holidays from the Pathloom family! 2021 hasn’t been easy for anyone, but here’s to us all for making the most out of the toughest of situations! For us, and for many of you, our escape from this year’s sheer insanity involved getting out into the middle of nowhere, pitching a tent, and soaking up every last drop of the outdoors we could possibly take in (to be fair, that was our escape last year too... OK maybe every year, but even more so lately). 

We’d like to share with you some of the Pathloom staff’s favorite sites we camped at in 2021. However, in keeping with our annual tradition, once again we're going to switch it up a bit from the typical list you'd find on other websites, and give you our favorite sites for each time of day. Do you love a good sunrise? Check out our “Morning” picks. Prefer to stay up late and see a night sky filled with stars? We’ve got you covered there too, scroll down to the “Night” section! Whatever makes the particularly perfect campsite for you, we’ve got you covered!

Do you feel like your area of the country isn't properly represented on our list? Let us know, we're always looking for the best campsites to share with our community!  If you’ve got some recommendations (and pictures!) for your favorite campsites in other parts of the country, we’d love to hear about them! Send an email to blog@pathloom.com , or click here to check out our story submission guidelines! 

Without further ado, here are Pathloom’s Picks for our favorite campsites of 2021! 
 Grand Teton National Park, WY - Photo Credit: Sierra Jones

Best for the Morning: 
 Lone Rock Beach Campground (dispersed camping), Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, AZ: “Got there in the pitch black of night with no idea what was around us - woke up at sunrise to the sound of the water from the beautiful lake meeting the shoreline. Beach camping for the win!”

Wolfe's Neck Oceanfront Camping, Freeport, ME: “One of the more developed campgrounds on this list, but offers some of the best oceanfront sunrises I've encountered anywhere on the East Coast. Sits on the land of a fully-operational farm, allowing visitors (especially kids) the opportunity to spend the day seeing the agriculture process in action and tasting fresh food from their quaint farm store. 

Leigh Lake (backcountry site), Grand Teton National Park, WY: “The best views of the Teton Range, and we were able to witness the ’smoky’ lake effect with the morning evaporation. Also a great spot to jump into the lake for a morning dip!”

 Island Lake: Bridger-Teton National Forest, WY - Photo Credit: Brett Stanton

Best for Mid-day: 
 Island Lake (backcountry site): Titcomb Basin Trail, Bridger Teton National Forest, WY: “Awe-inspiring scenery wherever you look. Great place to set up and explore around one of the many picturesque alpine lakes on this route. Really, any backcountry site along the Titcomb Basin Trail will provide an unforgettable experience.” 

Mill Creek Campground, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, CA: “As quiet and relaxing as it gets. Sit among the giants and take in the serenity of this lesser-known valley campground, offering plenty of fantastic sites. ”

South Fork Cascade Canyon Camping Zone, Grand Teton National Park, WY: “Many of the sites immediately upon entering the camping zone sit on elevated rock croppings, separated by classic alpine meadows and various little creeks. On the way between our two private ‘villas’ we encountered a mountain goat mother and her kid and stopped to watch them for nearly an hour - hard to beat a moment like that!”

 Marufo Vega Trail: Big Bend National Park, TX -Photo Credit: Brett Stanton

Best for the Evening:
 Big Bend National Park (Marufo Vega backcountry site), TX: “A truly incredible sunset in one of the most remote places in the entire contiguous U.S.”

Loon Lake (dispersed camping), Eldorado National Forest, CA: "Breathtaking sunsets over this crystal clear alpine lake, plenty of opportunities for swimming or kayaking, close proximity to the Rubicon Trail for offroading or hiking. The moonrise reflecting off the water is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen (check out the cover photo above!)"

Chihuahuan Desert (dispersed camping), Lobo, TX: "Deep in the heart of the West Texas desert, mile after mile of scrubland without a tree in sight. The only shade in the area comes from immense mountains just to the Southwest, which are the only thing separating the US from Mexico. Wispy clouds reflect vivid oranges, pinks, purples, reds, and yellows splashed across the evening sky."

 Williams Bottom Campground: Moab, UT - Photo Credit: Abby Voce

Best for the Night:
 Williams Bottom Camping Area, Moab, UT: “Hard to beat the night skies anywhere in Southern Utah! This particular destination sits far enough away from the hustle and bustle (and light pollution) of the town of Moab to offer spectacular stargazing opportunities.” 

Cottonwood Campground, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, ND: “Hours away from anything resembling a major city, the utter lack of light pollution and sparse tree cover provide a 360-degree view of an impossibly bright starscape.” 

Tom's Best Spring Road, North of Bryce Canyon National Park, UT: “A true hidden gem, this dispersed camping zone allows you ample opportunity to take in the famous Utah night skies.”


Happy holidays everyone! Stay safe and healthy so we can see you at one of these campsites sometime soon!

 3 Brand New Movies to Stream on Netflix
 
The Alpinist (2021)

This extraordinary film tells the story of Marc-André Leclerc, the quintessential solo adventurer. Through his epic ascents of some of the most difficult peaks in the Americas, he demonstrates the art of surviving insane situations in remote mountains alone. With no camera crews and no ropes, he lets the mountains decide his fates throughout each of his expeditions. Leclerc notes that his accomplishments are not what changed his life, it was the ability to overcome barriers that left him with an experience much greater than the achievements themselves. However, the freedom of solo alpinism comes with deadly risks… 
(Netflix)





14 Peaks: Nothing is Impossible (2021)

14 Peaks: Nothing is Impossible encapsulates the adventures of Nepali climber Nimsdai Purja, as he embarks on Project Possible, to summit all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter peaks in record time.

Purja and his team of sherpas define themselves in the mountains, and live every moment to the fullest. The incredible story of his fierce determination, and the unforgiving nature of the mountains are exhibited throughout this chronicle of his record breaking journey.

The Summit of the Gods (2021)

This animated documentary is based on the Japanese manga series written by Jiro Taniguchi. The film details the story of a Japanese reporter who accidentally comes across another mountain climber that may have the camera that belonged to George Mallory, who disappeared in 1924 while attempting to climb Mt. Everest. The reporter's quest to find the camera that can prove Mallory was the first to conquer Mt. Everest will lead him on an expedition of his own.

Giant Forest in Sequoia National Park to Reopen on Limited Basis In Wake of Devastating Wildfires

Beginning this past Saturday, the Giant Forest in Sequoia National Park has once again opened to the public for the first time since September - albeit on a limited schedule. For the next few weeks, the home of the General Sherman Tree will be open 4 days per week, 8am through sunset, though it will stay open seven days per week between Christmas and New Year's Day to accommodate an expected increase in visitors. At that point, officials will reassess the sustainability of the expanded schedule to determine days/hours to open throughout the new year. Some roads, trails, and areas of the park will remain closed, and other restrictions may apply, so it’s important to check the park’s website prior to any trip. 

The Giant Forest has been closed since mid-September 2021, as result of the KNP Complex and Windy Wildfires that ravaged the region this past Fall. These two fires caused the death of up to 3,600 large Giant Sequoias (classified as any larger than 4 feet in diameter) - as much as 5% of the world’s population of these magnificent trees. While these numbers are indeed devastating, they actually represent a reduction from the previous year, when the Castle Fire destroyed up to 14% of this population. This is yet another example of the horrendous effects of unchecked climate change, as increased temperatures and drier conditions have led to even hotter droughts, leading to changes in how wildfires burn and impact the forests of the area.

National Park Service to Introduce Eco-Friendly Transit Options Within Parks

Thanks to the recently passed bipartisan infrastructure bill, up to $1.5 billion per year has been earmarked for the National Park Service to implement changes within individual parks to renovate and repair existing structure, as well as implement innovative new tools designed to alleviate the burdens of increased visitation to parks across the country. 

Yellowstone National Park, which has seen nearly 5 million visitors in 2021, is predicting the number of visitor vehicles to overwhelm the capabilities of the park by 2023, and therefore has been implementing automated shuttles to help alleviate this growing demand. Similarly, Zion National Park expects to add dozens of electric shuttles (and electric car charging stations) in early 2022. Other parks are planning to introduce electric scooters and bikes as zero-emissions methods of transportation for their visitors.

NPS to Implement Permit Program for Iconic Angels Landing Hike in Zion National Park

Beginning April 1, 2022, any visitors to Zion National Park in Southwestern Utah who plan to hike the iconic Angels Landing trail will require a permit to do so. Those permits will be allotted via lottery system at Recreation.gov, with the first lottery opening on January 3, 2022. Information on how to register for this and future lotteries can be found here. 

The permit system is being implemented on a pilot program basis to alleviate overcrowding and congestion on the trail, as Parks across the country seek innovative strategies to accommodate the vast increases in visitors experienced since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. A nominal fee will be charged for each application, which covers up to 6 people for the hike. Strict restrictions apply for cancellations and/or date changes for these permits, so make sure your group’s plans are set in stone prior to initiating the application process.

New Historic Preservation Agreements Signed between NPS and Native American Tribes

The National Park Service has partnered with seven additional Native American tribes across seven states to ensure tribal interests are properly represented when historic preservation plans are developed and implemented in these areas. These seven new tribes join 200 others across the country that have taken over preservation duties that would otherwise be the responsibility of individual state authorities. This program is dedicated to the preservation and protection of resources and traditions that are of importance to Native Americans, and offers grants and other tools to facilitate this preservation. 

The seven new tribes introduced to this program are the Cowlitz in Washington, the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo in Texas, the Southern Ute Tribe in Colorado, Resighini Rancheria in California, The Utes of the Uintah &amp; Ouray Reservation in Utah, the Santo Domingo Pueblos of New Mexico, and the Moapa Band of Paiutes in Nevada.

Grand Teton National Park Moves All Campground Reservations to Recreation.gov

Park authorities for popular camping destination Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming have consolidated reservation systems for all campgrounds within the park over to Recreation.gov in anticipation of a busy Summer 2022 season. Private companies, local call centers, and websites utilized for reservations in the past will no longer be valid - for RV and tent sites alike. Other parks that have introduced improvements to their reservation systems have experienced shortened lines, reduced wait times, and an overall improvement in traffic conditions throughout the park. Campgrounds within the park open for the summer 2022 season as early as April 29th, and reservations using the new system are available up to six months in advance.

Winter Options Abound at National Parks Across Country

While the weather may not be as conducive to hiking and camping in National Parks across the country as it may have been several months ago, dozens of parks are still offering plenty of in-person and virtual options for recreation throughout the holiday season and beyond. Get in the festive spirit with a holiday song, liven up your apartment’s living room with a crackling fire, or plan out a trip to take a train ride, a First Day Hike, explore a cave, or just take a simple drive through the winter editions of some of the most beautiful regions of the country!

(published 11/1/2021)

"With the right preparation, you’ll have an incredible hike. This is one of the most beautiful and remote locations I’ve ever experienced (fun fact: Big Bend is one of the furthest spots you can be in the U.S. from the nearest traffic light!) This hike also features my favorite backcountry campsite of all time (and I’ve seen quite a few)!"

(published 11/15/2021)

"Moab, a city in Eastern Utah, is the home of Canyonlands and Arches National Parks. This region of the state is known as a red-rock wonderland. The iconic rock formations attract millions of visitors each year that cause serious traffic jams, so much so that Park officials are pushing for reservation systems to be implemented. Spending the day mountain biking, rock climbing, or visiting Dead Horse Point State Park (located right between the two famous National Parks) might be the perfect alternative to waiting in long lines and fighting crowds at popular scenic pull-offs. Although rock climbing these magnificent red-rock walls or mountain biking on Utah's famed terrain is not for the faint of heart, Moab is known as a mecca for both."

(published 11/22/2021)

"It didn’t take long for me to fall in love with training in Santa Fe - it is truly a hiker’s and trail runner’s paradise. The area offers National Forests, Wilderness Areas, and other local parks and trail networks. While starting slow, I mostly frequented the La Tierra Trails, which were relatively flat and offered effectively unlimited customization for running routes. I had a blast getting an initial baseline level of fitness here on these trails."

As winter approaches and temperatures throughout much of the country begin to drop, many of us are searching for ways to enjoy the outdoors without being impacted by the cold. Three National Parks in particular are epic year-round destinations due to their constant temperature: Mammoth Cave, Wind Cave and Carlsbad Caverns National Parks all include very diverse landscapes on the surface, but their main attraction is underground. These three unique parks all incorporate caves that hold deep geologic and human history from thousands of years ago. Because the caves are protected from the elements, they keep a steady temperature during the year, and provide a perfect day-trip alternative to a harsh winter day above ground. There are still plenty of opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, even while it's getting bleak and depressing above ground!

 
Mammoth Cave National Park

 Mammoth Cave, located in South-Central Kentucky, is home to the longest cave system in the world. The cave's temperature averages 54 degrees year-round, so you can avoid the freezing weather during the winter - but don’t forget to bring layers in the summer months! Cave tours are in high demand, and it is highly recommended to book in advance here. There are tours varying in length from 0.25 to 2.5 miles long. Although the cave is the most popular location in the park, there are also 85 miles of trails, and access to both the Green and Nolin Rivers.

There are three campgrounds located within the park: Mammoth Cave Campground, Maple Springs Campground and Houchin Ferry Campground. I camped at Houchin Ferry Campground, which is a year-round, tent-only camping area with 12 sites located right next to the Green River. When I arrived I was the only one camping in the campground so I was able to enjoy the river peacefully. Because the campground is tucked away in the woods about 15 miles from the visitors center, it gives campers the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors unbothered by much of the outside world. However, be sure to plan ahead since there is no cell phone service. You can make reservations for any of the three campgrounds here. Mammoth Cave has also been newly designated as an International Dark-Sky Park because of its remote location far from light pollution. Take off your rain fly and enjoy the stars! 

Be sure to check out the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park right up the road in Hodgenville, KY on your way out!
 
Wind Cave National Park

 South Dakota is home to Wind Cave National Park. This park’s aboveground landscape is mostly prairie that offers grand views of the Black Hills National Forest, but underneath the surface Wind Cave is one of the longest and most complex cave systems in the world. Like Mammoth, the cave is 54 degrees year-round, so while South Dakota's average winter temperatures are in the 40’s you can escape the snow by heading underground. Entry into the park is free, although cave tour tickets are $12 each. Tickets can only be reserved in person at the visitors center on the day of the tour, which opens at 8am. These tours are extremely popular - I would recommend getting in line by 7:30am at the latest! If you can’t get a ticket, hike the Wild Cave Canyon Trail or Lookout Point Trail to see the adorable prairie dogs and American bison. But be careful - I was almost charged by a bison on the Lookout Point Trail! Though the temperatures may vary, the landscape is breathtaking both above and below ground.

 There is one campground within the park that rarely fills up - Elk Mountain Campground. Sites are first-come first-serve, and bathrooms are available. Although I was not the only one in this campground, it was quiet and groups usually stayed only a single night - so I had many new neighbors in my three days there. 

While you're visiting this region of South Dakota, it is more than worth the trip to Custer State Park, Badlands National Park and Mount Rushmore National Memorial - all three are located less than two hours from Wind Cave!  
 
Carlsbad Caverns National Park

Carlsbad Caverns National Park is located in the Chihuahuan Desert of southeastern New Mexico. What was once a guano mining area hundreds of years ago is now a world-renowned geological wonder, commemorated as a National Park nearly a century ago. The cavern is 56 degrees year round even though the desert on the surface can have record heat in the summer, and drop down into the 30s in the winter. Reservations for cave entrance must be made here. You can explore the cavern at your own pace on either the Big Room Trail or Natural Entrance Trail - 0.6 and 1.25 miles respectively. After your trip into the cavern, and if the weather permits - hike on the surface of the park to experience the Chihuahuan Desert, with amazing views of the Guadalupe Mountains!

There are no campgrounds inside Carlsbad, but I stayed just outside the entrance at White’s City RV park. The campground had laundry, showers, bathrooms and water available for campers. The campground was quiet enough that two mule deer surprised me as I was cooking dinner! 

 After your Carlsbad visit, head south to one of the most underrated National Parks, Guadalupe Mountains!

As the winter chill sets in across the country, exploring the outdoors can be especially daunting, difficult, and in many cases dangerous. These three unique, natural, cavernous environments provide great options to visit year-round, without the need for often expensive extreme weather gear stemming from severe weather conditions. Choose one of these iconic caves and plan a trip - but whenever possible, do so well in advance to maximize your experience while in the area!

December is (Almost) Here! Plan Your Winter Outdoor Adventures Now!
Don't Let Cold Weather Stop You From Getting Outside!


It’s just about December, which means winter has arrived for much of the country! For many, this means an end to the majority of their outdoor adventures until things begin to thaw and temperatures begin to rise. For others, that first snowfall represents yet another new beginning: the dawn of the season for skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, sledding, snowball fighting, ice skating, ice fishing, and so much more. 

Our friends at Snowcap Video Solutions certainly fall in the latter category, and are getting extremely excited as the first few snowfalls begin to grace their New England home. We worked with them to create a video highlighting some amazing winter activities while also showing off just how beautiful and majestically serene winter landscapes can get. Check out videos like this, trip reports, camping and road tripping playlists, and so much more on our YouTube channel!

National Park Service Celebrates Native American Heritage Month

There has long been a connection between the Native peoples indiginous to this continent and the National Parks, Forests, Monuments, etc scattered throughout the country - after all, they were here first, and the 85 million acres that constitute designated Park land was taken from them at some point throughout the dark annals of US history. While arguments that stewardship of Park lands should be handed entirely over to indiginous peoples have gone largely unheard, over the past several years the National Park Service has at least been making a modicum of additional effort to recognize the significance that Natives have had on the history of these protected lands. 

In honor of November’s dedication as “Native American Heritage Month,” the National Park Service as a whole and many individual National Parks will be hosting a series of events to celebrate the history and traditions of the indiginous people of this land. Check out this calendar to see which parks are hosting events, and to find out more information about the events themselves.

Free Entrance to all National Parks on Veteran’s Day

The final Free Entrance Day for all of America’s National Park Service sites will be this Thursday, November 11th, in celebration of Veteran’s Day. Entrance fees for Parks will be waived for all visitors - which means already crowded Parks will see some of their largest crowds of the year - so if you’re planning to take advantage make sure to arrive early! Many Parks allow for reservations to be made online in advance: consult the specific Park’s website on NPS.gov for more info. As always (well, as of Veteran’s Day 2020, anyway), all active duty military, veterans, and Gold Star Families are never required to pay a fee to access our country’s National Parks, click here for more info on that program.

Fossil of New Species Discovered at Canyonlands National Park

Scientists recently unearthed what could be a previously undiscovered new species of ‘early reptile relative’ in Canyonlands National Park in Southern Utah. Retrieval of this fossil necessitated a 13 mile backcountry hike by the team of paleontologists, who had to act fast after initial discovery to ensure the specimen didn’t get washed away by flash flooding that frequently impacts the area. Though an exact determination has yet to be made, initial assessment of the fossil estimates it to be as much as 290 million years old!

Heavy Rains and Snow Impact Wildfires in Northern California

After much devastation across the state, which began earlier in the year than most are accustomed to, many of the horrendous wildfires in Northern California are finally reaching safe containment levels - or outright extinguishment. This includes the Dixie Fire, second largest in California history, which ravaged much of Lassen Volcanic National Park. Some officials throughout the region are even declaring an end to Wildfire Season 2021. (Others aren’t so sure - moisture levels in the air and on the ground haven’t quite reached safe levels in many areas). 

This comes in the wake of an ‘atmospheric river’ weather pattern that saw historic amounts of precipitation dumped on drought-stricken, tinderbox-flammable areas of the state that had been ravaged by fires for months on end. While most of the danger seems to be in the past for the Northern part of the state, the same cannot yet be said for points to the South - for example the KNP Complex Fire that threatens Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon National Parks (home of the General Sherman, the largest tree in the world) is still only at 75% containment. But this is still promising news in the wake of a year that brought some of the most destructive wildfires in the state’s history.

Mammoth Cave certified Intl Dark Sky Park

Most visitors come to Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky to experience the immense underground network of tunnels from whence the Park got its name. This new designation of the Park by the International Dark Sky Association showcases that Mammoth has plenty to offer up on the surface as well. The IDA certification indicates that the Park is officially one of the best places in the world for stargazing, and was obtained after a long process of retrofitting light fixtures throughout the surface level of the park to ensure minimal light pollution. There are ample ranger-led and self-guided opportunities to take in the bounty of the night sky, at Mammoth and at over 30 other Dark Sky Parks throughout the National Park system.

National Park Road Closures Beginning in November

Planning a trip to a National Park this winter? Make sure you check their website first! (Honestly, not a bad idea prior to a visit regardless of the time of year). Many Parks shut down roads for the season for general maintenance, snow preparation, or because they become downright impassible once inclement weather hits. In some cases, such as at Rocky Mountain National Park, Lassen Volcanic, or Yellowstone, major thoroughfares will be closed to the public, which could necessitate hours-long detours just to get around the park if not properly prepared for. Most National Parks still have plenty to offer in the colder months - but be advised that additional planning may be required!

"As I mentioned last week, my experience out West has led me to believe that for all California has in terms of natural beauty, the foliage here in the Autumn months comes up a bit lacking. So for the purposes of this post, we'll be focusing on the Pacific Northwest ranging down to the Southwest - perhaps our California audience may be inspired to get out of their home state to see what else the West has to offer."

"Yes, we realize this is quite a large area to cover in just a single post. But if we keep breaking this up region-by-region, there won't be any leaves left on the trees by the time we finish! So, in the interest of getting you this information as soon as possible, we've combined our picks for the Midwest and the Mountain West regions of the country."

"Perennial Fat Bear Week Heavyweight Otis has once again captured the Fat Bear Crown up at Katmai National Park in Alaska! The 8th Annual Fat Bear Week tournament was a hard-fat battle between 3-time chompion Otis and a bountiful brisket of some of the fattest competitors this tournament has ever seen. Despite a few missing teeth and increasing competition for fishing spots from younger, bigger bears, the masses have spoken (96K+ voters in the final round!) and Otis has overcome the odds as Fat Bear Week Champ for the fourth time."

Should you be inclined to recreate any aspects of this trip for yourself, please be sure to check the Forest’s website for potential closures, as even once the fire has been extinguished parts of the area may still be dangerous."

There is something unique about experiencing the beauty of a National Park away from the crowds. Something fascinating about being able to set up a time lapse for a sunset and having no people in the way. The beauty is so much more profound when you adventure through underappreciated lands with no lines, no masses of people, and no advanced reservations. Voyageurs, Guadalupe Mountains and the Black Canyon of the Gunnison are just three National Parks that are more than worth the journey to appreciate in such a rare environment.

Located in northern Minnesota, this gem of a park is a mixture of dry and wet ecosystems that extend across the Canadian border. Voyageurs National Park has no entrance fee, and activities for everyone. While there are many walking and hiking trails along the shore, to truly experience the magic of this park you need to take to the water. Fishing and boating charters are popular, as are kayaking and canoeing. I highly recommend taking a sunset tour of Kabetogama Lake with Bill from Border Guide Service. Once out on the water, the wildlife and scenery is surreal. When the sun goes down, don't forget to look for the northern lights! 

Accommodations: 

I camped about a 10 minute drive East of the Kabetogama Lake Visitors Center at the Woodenfrog Campground. The campground is located on the water, with boat launches and docks available to use. There are pit toilets and water spouts available throughout the campground. If you're looking for a shower, head into the lake just a few feet away from your site! You'll spend the night listening to the water lap on the shore and loons calling in the distance.  Don’t forget lots of bug spray if you're visiting in the early summer!

Guadalupe Mountains National Park - Texas 
Guadalupe Peak: Guadalupe Mountains National Park, TX - Photo Credit: Abby Voce 


Salt Flat, Texas, located about 2 hours East of El Paso, is home to Guadalupe Mountains National Park. This park, accessible via a $10 entrance fee, includes 8 of the 10 highest peaks in Texas and is on the list for the least visited National Parks. In my opinion, the most rewarding activity in the park is hiking to Guadalupe Peak, the highest peak in Texas. This strenuous 8.4 mile trail with 3,000 feet of elevation gain yields outstanding vistas throughout. Tips: start before 6am and be prepared for high winds. The hike is steep and grueling, but after each switchback the views get better and better. On your way home, stop at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, only a 30 minute drive to the North! 

Accommodations: 

At the base of Guadalupe Peak Trail is Pine Springs Campground, open year-round. Since I have visited, the campground has changed over to a reservation system for both tent and RV sites. During my visit it was first-come, first-serve; and I was able to car camp in the RV lot. Again, high winds are normal in the area so be prepared to weigh down your tent! There are no showers here, but there are flush toilets and running water. Since the campground shares parking with the busy Guadalupe Peak trailhead, plan to start hiking early in the morning to avoid the crowds, the heat, and the noisy parking lot.

Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park - Colorado

Located in western Colorado is the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. If you're looking for a laid back, uncongested park with easy hiking trails, opportunities for extreme activities, and beautiful canyon views throughout... this is the park for you! The entrance fee is $30, and the park can be accessed from either the North or South Rim. Trails such as Oak Flat, Uplands, Rim Rock and Warner Point are all easy hikes that provide excellent views of the canyon walls and Colorado River. 

The most common way to explore the inner canyon is through hiking. Extreme sports are popular here too such as white water rafting and kayaking; as well as eminent rock climbing routes up on the canyon walls themselves. During my nightly yoga routine, I met rock climbers in the campground that were off to spend a few strenuous days climbing the canyon walls. If you're planning to explore the inner canyon be sure to obtain a free first-come, first-serve wilderness permit.

Accommodations: 

I camped at the South Rim Campground, equipped with pit toilets and running water during the warmer months. The sites at the campground are rather close together, but there is still plenty of room to set up a tent - although I car camped for both nights. Mule deer are a common sight within the campground, and often meander close by while you're cooking dinner. If making your way into this area, prepare for an off-the-grid trip when visiting - as there is no cell phone service throughout the park.

After visiting 51 National Parks, I’ve found there to be something truly special about the less popular parks. The calm and the effortless ability to explore is no longer the norm in National Parks. Overcrowding and reservations have brought millions of visitors into these lands. Perhaps the least visited parks are the only truly wild parks left?

Trip Report: Eldorado National Forest, California
Recapping a Dispersed Solo Camping Trip in March 2021, Before Wildfires Ravaged the Area

Check out more Trip Report videos at the Pathloom Youtube Channel! 

 In honor of the Caldor Fire in Eldorado National Forest reaching 98% containment and most restrictions/closures being reduced or removed over this past weekend (with rain and snowstorms on the way this week that will hopefully put the whole damn thing out!), we bring you this trip report from Spring 2021. Should you be inclined to recreate any aspects of this trip for yourself, please be sure to check the Forest’s website for potential closures, as even once the fire has been extinguished parts of the area may still be dangerous. For information on fire recovery efforts, click here.

Trip Info:

Trip Type: Dispersed Camping/Road Trip (Solo)
Season: March 2021 (Spring)
Location: Eldorado National Forest, Kyburz, CA
Duration: 3 days / 2 nights
Permit: Campfire Permit Required
Link: https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/eldorado/home 

Overview:

For this trip, I embarked on a solo road trip to Eldorado National Forest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Northeastern California. Eldorado National Forest, encompassing nearly 800,000 acres, is located in the Central Sierras near Lake Tahoe, surrounded by Tahoe National Forest to its north, Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit to its east, Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest to its south-east and Stanislaus National Forest to its south. The forest is a 3 to 4 hour drive from the Bay Area, and a 1.5 hour drive from Sacramento. The elevation in the forest ranges from 1,000 ft to 10,000 ft, and has many well-known rivers traversing through its mountainous terrains, such as the Mokelumne, American, Rubicon, Cosumnes and Silver Fork.

I mostly explored the corridor between Highway 50 and Highway 88 in the Kyburz and Grizzly Flats areas; Grizzly Flats would become the hotspot for the Caldor Fire that first ignited in August 2021. I had been to the Silver Fork River on many occasions before - it’s one of my favorite places for dispersed camping by a river. The river is surrounded by alpine tree-covered mountains on both sides, and during the summer you can see hordes of rafters and kayakers making their way down the river. I camped the first night on a beach right off the river. The second day, I went exploring in the Iron Mountain and Sly Park area, a place where I hadn’t spent much time before. It was an ideal time to explore the foothills as the higher elevation areas still had snowpack above 8,000 ft. I found an opening near Iron Mountain with views of the surrounding mountain peaks, and this is where I camped for my second night. On the third day, I spent some time at a few lakes on my drive back to the Bay Area via Highway 88. Throughout the trip, I encountered snow along the roads at higher elevations, but not enough to necessitate the use of snow chains. Overall, it was a great solo camping trip early in the season.

Trip Planning:

Permits:

Permits are required for campfires. Depending on where you’re hiking or spending the night, permits may also be required for Wilderness Areas. Due to the widespread wildfire activity this year, most areas are not currently allowing campfires, and other areas are currently only open for day use. 

Camping:

There are many dispersed camping options throughout the forest, spanning from rivers and creeks to high-elevation forests. It is important to pay attention to regulations for dispersed camping. There are many scattered areas of private property throughout the forest as well where recreation is prohibited. Cellphone service is limited throughout the forest, especially in the more remote areas.

Itinerary:

Day 1: Bay Area to Silver Fork River via Hwy 50

Drove to the Silver Fork River accessed from Kyburz via Silver Fork Road. I went past the China Flat Campground and started scouting for potential campsites next to the river. There was snow on the road from before the campsite, but was traversable without the need for chains with my All-Wheel-Drive vehicle. I found a spot right off the road, but as there was minimal traffic it was perfect. The campsite had snow patches on the ground and a rock ring for campfires. It was on a sandy beach right off the river, which made for pleasant white noise from the water flowing over rocks. I set up camp and started collecting fallen branches from the surrounding trees. After sunset, I got the campfire going and had a sandwich that I picked up on my drive. Once it became dark, I did some stargazing before the Moon rose from the horizon, which made for a spectacular sight with the snow and water reflecting from the moonlight. I eventually called it a night, put out the fire, and slept with the sound of the river flowing right next to me.

Campsite Location: Off Silver Fork Road (Kyburz), near China Flat Campground
Campsite Type: Dispersed

Day 2: Silver Fork River to Iron Mountain via Mormon Emigrant Trail

I woke up to the sunlight shining through my rainfly and took a stroll along the river. I got a small fire going to heat up my leftovers in foil - one of my favorite types of cooking/reheating methods while camping. After breakfast, I packed up camp, and set off for the day in my car. I briefly consulted my offline maps on my phone before deciding to explore the Sly Park Recreation Area in the foothills near Grizzly Flats, an area I hadn’t spent much time in before. I drove around various forest service roads, some leading to dead ends, snow blockages or roads simply being closed due to it being early in the season. 

After taking a few detours to access the Grizzly Flats area, I found myself near Iron Mountain, and it seemed like a good time to look for campsites as it was getting late in the afternoon. I found an idyllic site at a big opening with flat areas for setting up camp. I didn’t stop there, I drove around a bit more looking for other options as well, but ended up just finding mostly snow blockages. Hence, I eventually drove back to that campsite and started setting up camp and exploring the area more. 

This campsite was a ways off the main road, which meant seclusion and no noise from cars passing by. I did find many shotgun shells littering the area, something which I unfortunately find too common in many National Forests and BLM areas I’ve been to. I took a hike along a trail that went by the campsite, and found some openings through the alpine trees offering views of the snow-capped mountains in the distance. Once back at camp, I made a late lunch, and started gathering deadwood around the campsite. As the evening set in, I got the fire going and settled in for a relaxing evening. Eventually I called it a night, and slept underneath the bright full moon.

Day 3: Iron Mountain to Bay Area via Hwy 88

I woke up after a restful night and began to make some breakfast. After I ate, I packed up camp and consulted my maps to decide on my route back to the Bay Area. I decided to cut through the forest via the Sly Park main road to connect to Hwy 88. As I made my way, I stopped at a few of the many lakes along the way for lunch and some relaxing reading. Eventually, I was on Hwy 88, which I took to I-5 to make my way home after an awesome weekend solo camping trip.

Otis wins Fat Bear Week 2021!

Perennial Fat Bear Week Heavyweight Otis has once again captured the Fat Bear Crown up at Katmai National Park in Alaska! The 8th Annual Fat Bear Week tournament was a hard-fat battle between 3-time chompion Otis and a bountiful brisket of some of the fattest competitors this tournament has ever seen. Despite a few missing teeth and increasing competition for fishing spots from younger, bigger bears, the masses have spoken (96K+ voters in the final round!) and Otis has overcome the odds as Fat Bear Week Champ for the fourth time. 

Though the competition has concluded, BearCams can still be viewed at explore.org. We previously covered how these cameras are “some of the most entertaining, enjoyable, and strangely cathartic viewing opportunities on the internet” - so we highly encourage you to check them out before the bears begin their long winter of hibernation! 

Otis was last seen celebrating this monumental and unprecedented victory by… well… eating more salmon.

New Evidence of Human Habitation in North America, 10,000 Years Prior to Previous Estimate

Researchers in White Sands National Park in New Mexico have found footprints buried under the gypsum from which the Park gets its name that suggest humans lived in North America as far back as 24,000 years ago - a significant increase from the previously agreed upon range of 13,500-16,000 years. This exciting discovery completely rewrites prehistoric history on this continent, and opens the door for additional discoveries down the road. Footprints and other historical evidence continue to surface in this area, which was one of the primary reasons White Sands was redesignated from a National Monument into a National Park in 2019. 

Discoveries such as this truly highlight the importance of the strict observance of Leave No Trace principles when visiting National Parks and other historical areas - the more we can do to leave these places undisturbed when visiting, the more information that can be gleaned by professionals working to better understand our past.

New Underground Railroad Historical Locations Designated by the National Park Service

The National Park Service has recently dedicated 18 additional sites to the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, to add to the 698 sites already designated in years past. These new sites range from Ohio to Florida, and are instrumental in continuing to tell the tale of freedom fighters and allies who fought against state-sanctioned oppression throughout the history of our nation. A listing of the new sites by state can be found on the NPS website. 

Some of the new designations, including Pensacola Pass within Florida’s Gulf Islands National Seashore, aim to shine more light on the sea routes taken by seekers of freedom - seeking refuge from enslavement in the South down in the Caribbean or up in New England.

Yellowstone sets Attendance Record for September, Annual Visits

The month of September saw over 872,000 visitors to Yellowstone National Park, an all-time record for the month and a 4% increase over the previous year. Many monthly attendance records have been set this year for the Park, as Covid-frustrated tourists liberated from pandemic lockdown take to the National Park System for recreation. In fact, even with 3 months remaining in the year Yellowstone has already surpassed their all-time annual attendance record set in 2016. 

If you’re planning on a visit to Yellowstone before the year is through, you may want to consider visiting some off-the-beaten-path areas of the park in an attempt to avoid the large crowds. Check out this piece from the Pathloom Blog highlighting some of Yellowstone’s hidden gems!

KNP Complex Wildfire threatens Largest Tree in the World

In early September, a lightning storm caused two large wildfires to break out in Kings Canyon Sequoia National Park and Sequoia National Forest in California, which eventually merged together to become the KNP Complex Wildfire. Among the thousands of beautiful acres facing total annihilation, the fire also threatens the General Sherman - widely regarded as the largest tree in the world at 275 feet tall and 36 feet wide. Great lengths have been taken to protect this tree and allow it to continue its mammoth growth, including frequent prescribed burns in the immediate area as recently as 2019. So far the Sherman remains standing, but 26 groves of Giant Sequoias in the area were not so fortunate, succumbing to the flames over the past month of burn.

Though the worst of the wildfire seems to now be in the past, the trees are not out of the ‘woodwork’ just yet, as the fire remains only 45% contained. That being said, though the landscape of such a breathtaking area will be forever changed, prospects look good for eventual containment and a return to relative normalcy for the area in the near future. In the meantime, rangers in the area have wrapped the General Sherman in foil to ensure it remains safe from the blaze.

Leaf Season Hits Blue Ridge Parkway

Every Autumn, and specifically every October, millions of motorists traverse the Blue Ridge Parkway in search of some of the most beautiful fall foliage to grace the planet. The Parkway, which runs from Shenandoah to Great Smoky Mountains National Parks through Virginia and North Carolina, features hours of windy roads and dozens of scenic overlooks that are perfect for leaf peeping across magnificent mountain vistas. While the large crowds of October can cause heavy traffic along the route, many would consider the delays to be well worth the brilliant colors of the changing leaves (and if you don’t consider yourself to be all that patient, make sure to at least take this drive on weekdays rather than weekends!).

We here at Pathloom love leaf peepin’ season, and have a few galleries in our blog devoted to that passion. For foliage photos of the Blue Ridge Parkway and other locations throughout the country, click here for the East, West, and everything in between!

It’s October. The air is crisp and cool, leaves are on the ground, and most importantly, Halloween is right around the corner. You may think that there aren't many outdoors-centric ways to celebrate the season but the truth is, creepy parks rumored to be haunted can be found all throughout the US. Many of these parks have creepy ghost stories attached to them, which you can learn about from park rangers or locals who know them best; while others just seem to have an overall vague eerie feel to them. People who visit these parks report feeling unsettled and even witnessing inexplicable things. If you’re brave enough, try witnessing these strange phenomena yourself - you might find something unbelievable.

Batona Trail - New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, NJ

Batona Trail is a 50 mile trail located in the Pine Barrens, home to the legendary Jersey Devil. Because of this, this trail is one of the most famous haunted hikes in the world, with rich history surrounding the Pine Barrens as a whole. If you want to get a taste of the creepy forest and all its intricacies, this trail is perfect as it covers much of the park’s most beautiful sites, and crosses through three state forests. This trail passes by old, abandoned buildings and ruins from a 300-year old town, so you’ll get a feel for the origin of the folklore, and see the real place that was terrorized by the demon itself. 

There have been many accounts of sightings of this creature and although it is rumored to wreak havoc on all areas of South Jersey, venturing into the heart of the forest will get you as intimate an adventure with the demon as you can get. Be sure to speak to locals while you’re here, who will be full of creepy stories concerning America’s only state demon.

Hell Hollow - Pachaug State Forest, Connecticut

Pachaug is the largest State Forest in Connecticut, attracting hikers and campers alike from all over the state. However, an unsettling history has its roots within this gorgeous green space. Multiple visitors to the forest have reported the same thing: hearing blood-curdling screams from deep within the woods with no known origin. Many speculate that the screams originate from a Native American woman who was killed by British soldiers over 300 years ago. 

This is not the only bit of haunted lore attached to the attraction, however, as one area of the park in particular - aptly named Hell Hollow Pond - is said to be the creepiest part of the entire forest. The lake is often covered with a gray fog that gives it kind of a Scooby-Doo effect, which is fitting as it is considered to be the most haunted area of Pachaug. Although some speculate that the Satanic name is actually derived from the area’s hellishly bad farming conditions, many visitors still feel a creepy presence - and many have even reported seeing a dark figure looming around the lake. 

Employees at this State Forest deny the presence of ghosts here and insist on practical excuses for the alleged sightings, but this doesn’t stop hundreds of brave souls flocking to the park every year to see what they can find for themselves. Why not try for yourself?

Mammoth Cave National Park - Cave City, Kentucky

Kentucky’s gorgeous Mammoth Cave National Park is the world’s longest known cave system. Extending over 400 miles, this National Park is a gem in the heart of western Kentucky. If trekking through dark caves doesn’t seem creepy enough for you though, you might be intrigued to know that this National Park is home to over 150 documented paranormal events. It’s no wonder the Travel Channel called this spot one of The Scariest Haunted Hiking Trails in the U.S., and it is often considered the “most haunted natural wonder in the world.” 

What really gives Mammoth Cave this title is the history of people who have died within this cave system. In 1839, a doctor by the name of John Croghan purchased the cave for $10,000, believing the dark and moist conditions might be good for treating tuberculosis patients. He then took 15 patients as well as several enslaved people into the cave to begin experimental treatments. However, the wet and incredibly enclosed conditions of the caves caused the condition of the patients to worsen and in a matter of months, two patients died and all the other patients’ illnesses had escalated. Within a few years, Croghan himself died of tuberculosis as well. Visitors to Mammoth Cave National Park can still see remains of Dr. Croghan’s "consumptive cabins”, including a stone slab where bodies were stacked on top of each other - appropriately named Corpse Rock. 

Clearly, the history of this location is absolutely chilling, and paranormal events only add to this. Another of the most famous stories involves a park ranger seeing a mysterious man appear and then disappear during a tour of the caves, wearing a miner’s uniform. Another tour guide working inside the caves claims that a woman saw a man holding a lantern and wearing the traditional clothing of slave guides. He then disappeared, and although some believe that this figure was actually an illusion created by shadows, others are not too sure as he was seen from every angle. Whatever you believe, Mammoth Cave National Park is widely known as the scariest of all National Parks - and visitors should beware, as it’s not for the faint of heart.

Iron Goat Trail - Steven’s Pass, WA

Iron Goat Trail was the site of one of the worst railroad disasters in American history, when an avalanche caused two trains to run off the tracks - causing the deaths of almost 100 people. Today, you can hike through the scene of this incident via this 9-mile trail. The abandoned tunnels and snow sheds are still present so you’ll be able to feel as if you were there over 100 years ago, and signage around the trail will help you learn more about that fateful day as well as the people who built the railroad. Once you’ve gotten a sense of the trail’s history, you may start to feel a bit creeped out - and you wouldn’t be alone in that feeling! 

Many visitors feel that the site is haunted, and some have reported hearing screams and voices both in and around the railroad tracks. Others report feeling invisible hands touching them as they walk along the railroad tracks. Still, the trail is gorgeous and an amazing scenic route to take if you’re looking for a creepy hike in the daytime - as the trail is closed at night. Some say this is to prevent hikers from getting into trouble at night... but others say that even park rangers are too scared to go onto the railroad tracks once the sun goes down.

Ghost House Trail - Big Ridge State Park, TN

This aptly named trail sits in the heart of Tennessee’s Big Ridge State Park, and was the site of alleged witch hangings and scalpings of Native Americans. However, Ghost House Trail officially got its name from the house of the Hutchinson family, who lived there in the 1800s. Here, the daughter Mary died of tuberculosis, and neighbors continued to hear screams coming from the house long after the family moved away. Others claim to have seen Mary’s dog, still walking around the park. 

The house is currently in ruins so you won’t be able to walk through, but you’ll still be able to see the skeleton of the domicile. Before you even get to the house, you’ll pass several cemeteries where Civil War soldiers are buried - and many speculate on the existence of ghosts here as well. This gives the trail an instantly creepy vibe and will certainly get you into the Halloween spirit. Don’t be afraid to ask questions of the Big Ridge employees who will be sure to have plenty of other creepy anecdotes as well!

"The USFS cites an unprecedented wildfire season as the reason for this decision - with 1.7 million acres of forest already in ashes and firefighting resources throughout the state stretched to their absolute limit. Those responsible for this difficult decision hope that it will reduce the risk of people being endangered by these ongoing fires, as well as the likelihood for additional fires to break out."

"The iconic training montage from arguably the best installment of the Rocky franchise (best villain anyway) was not actually filmed in Siberia as the movie portrayed, but instead on location throughout Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. Silly Ivan Drago’s advanced training techniques in the gym proved to be no match in the ring for Rocky’s manhandling of the park’s innocent logs."

(published 9/13/2021)

"Do your part to keep our forests safe from further damage - no one wants to be the person who sets off the next great wildfire! Short of implementing sweeping political changes to stem the tide of ongoing climate change, there isn't much we can do to prevent the drought conditions that leave our wilderness so susceptible to fire damage. While we can't control where the next bolt of lightning may strike, we can control for human error."

(published 9/16/2021)

"Additionally, the alpine terrain can make for unpredictable weather - so be sure to check in with a backcountry ranger before you begin for the latest forecast, and avoid any exposed areas if you see ominous clouds rolling in. With high-alpine terrain comes a short hiking season - due to snow, you likely won’t be able to safely attempt this hike outside of a short window between early August and mid-September."

Fat Bear Week 2021 Begins Today!
It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year!

Fat Bear Week 2020 winner, the mighty "747" - Photo Credit: N. Boak 


Every September, explore.org teams up with the park rangers of Katmai National Park in Alaska to bring us FAT BEAR WEEK - which is exactly as amazing as it sounds. With winter fast approaching, the ursine residents of the park have been working hard stuffing themselves with thousands of calories worth of salmon, to fuel themselves for a long season of hibernation. To that effect, now is the time of year when these brown bears have reached peak physical fatness - a time to be celebrated by all fortunate enough to view them in all of their glorious obesity. 

In an effort to spread the wealth, the Park Rangers up at Katmai have set up cameras within park limits to capture bears doing bear things. These rangers have 10 cameras streaming throughout various areas of the park where the bear population is known to frequent - allowing people across the world to safely appreciate the epic hilarity that only the fattest of bears can provide.

The live streamed BearCams set up by the Katmai rangers are some of the most entertaining, enjoyable, and strangely cathartic viewing opportunities on the internet. These cameras run year-round, but this time of year features some of the highest rates of activity as the bears scramble to pack on the pounds in anticipation of a long winter of hibernation. Sometimes they fish, sometimes they eat, sometimes they battle for prime fishing and eating locations.... and sometimes they just take a nap. Bear cubs are also prevalent on these video feeds - perhaps the only safe way for the majority of us to get a good look at these adorable (and also fat) majestic balls of fluff. 


Not enough action on this livestream? Click here to see all the FatBearCams that explore.org has to offer! 


Because this is America, where the spirit of competition invades everything we do (for better or for worse), the enterprising folks at explore.org have turned the spectacle of fat bears into an interactive tournament, allowing fat bear aficionados to vote to ascertain which is the fattest bear in the park. 

This past weekend showcased the Junior Bracket, featuring the inaugural tournament to ascertain the fattest of Fat Bear Cubs - with the winner earning an entry into the senior bracket. Congratulations, Fat Bear 132's Spring Cub, and best of luck fatting your way through the senior circuit! 

Today - Monday, September 27th at 7pm ET/4pm PT, the geniuses behind Fat Bear Week will reveal the 2021 bracket that enables bear-lovers around the world to vote elimination-style for their favorite fattest brown bear in Katmai. Click here for a sneak preview of the fattest of the fat, and be sure to head to explore.org between Wednesday, September 29th and Tuesday, October 5th to vote!

Water Purification Tips &amp; Tricks
Stay Healthy While Staying Hydrated Out In The Wild! 

Photo Credit: Robert Ritchie


Last week on the blog, we featured a series of fire safety tips that were originally posted to the Pathloom Instagram and TikTok pages. This week, we want to do the same with water safety, highlighting a few of the more popular methods for removing impurities, germs, and potentially dangerous bacteria from your water source while you're out hiking or camping.  

There are plenty of safe, effective ways to filter your water prior to drinking while out in the backcountry. Your preferred method will depend on a number of factors. If you've got a camp stove and a pot handy, you can boil everything - but if you're backpacking and trying to keep your pack's weight down, this might not be the best way of doing things. Tablets are great, extremely compact and easy to use - but they can take up to 30 minutes to work, which might be an issue if you're running out of time before the sun sets. A LifeStraw is an excellent, fast option for water filtration direct from the source - but you might not be able to get close enough to your water source to utilize it safely or properly. A SteriPen utilizes UV light to effectively kill germs and bacteria - but won't help with physical debris should any get into your water bottle. Choose an option that will work best with your planned itinerary for your trip.

A few tips and tricks for your water filtration edification:
Check warnings for the area you'll be camping/hiking in to see what sorts of impurities are found in the local water. Certain purification methods have various degrees of success against certain impurities, so make sure your method matches up to what you need to protect against!
This one is fairly self-explanatory, but if there's water available at your campsite, check to make sure it's potable before drinking!
Remember to let your water stay at a rapid boil for at least one minute before removing it from the heat and allowing it to cool. If you're at increased elevation you'll need to boil it for longer - 3 minutes for anything over a mile high.
Go for the chlorine dioxide tablets rather than iodine, which can turn your water yellowish. It's still safe to drink, but it doesn't look as appetizing and can leave a bit of an aftertaste. 
If using a SteriPen, make sure to stir it around your water bottle, as that increases the efficacy of the UV germ-killing technology. Bring extra batteries, too!
Be sure to replace the filters of your water filtration system on a regular basis - more often than the average person changes out their Brita filters, at the very least! (Note: don't actually use a Brita filter for backcountry water filtration, it is not graded for that and will not remove all traces of harmful bacteria!)

Fire Safety Tips &amp; Tricks
A Few Things to Remember when Camping during Wildfire Season
Aftermath of fires in Yosemite National Park, CA - Photo Credit: Chris Blake 


As was the case at this time last year, Wildfire season in the United States has been looking quite bleak, and due to the catastrophic impact of climate change there is good reason to believe this will be our new way of life until such a tide can be reversed. 3 million acres of wilderness are actively on fire as this is being written, with 5.5 million burnt in 2021 overall. Extreme drought, high winds, low humidity, and an increase in the number of lightning storms in regions where they were previously scarce all combine to create the ideal conditions for wildfires to spark, spread, and sweep rapidly across thousands of acres of wilderness (and often into towns as well!) 

A few weeks back, we ran a series of fire safety tips on our social media pages that received a great response from our community. In case you missed these on the Pathloom Instagram or TikTok sites, we wanted to post the collection here in our blog for easy review. 

Do your part to keep our forests safe from further damage - no one wants to be the person who sets off the next great wildfire! Short of implementing sweeping political changes to stem the tide of ongoing climate change, there isn't much we can do to prevent the drought conditions that leave our wilderness so susceptible to fire damage. While we can't control where the next bolt of lightning may strike, we can control for human error. 

Always check local fire danger conditions before you depart, seek guidance of local rangers if you have questions, and follow these four easy steps the next time you go camping to ensure proper fire safety for yourself and the world around you.

10,000 Wasted Lakes
The Impact of Climate Change on Minnesota - and What We Can Do To Help


I thought we had more time. I came back to Minnesota after a year away at school and returned to an unrecognizable home. In the process of making “10,000 Wasted Lakes” to highlight the impact of climate change in Minnesota, I learned just how tangible the effects of climate change could become in such a short time.

In the summer, heat waves are nothing uncommon in Minnesota - but what has changed is how long they are staying. From the Department of Natural Resources, a heat wave of such length and severity had never happened so early in the season. Temperatures observed in the first half of June resembled that of mid July. The heat of June set numerous records for earliest in-season occurrences of high temperatures across four separate regions within the state.

These high heats have had continued negative impacts on water access this summer with Minnesota facing droughts. In June alone, 87% of the state faced severe drought conditions - meaning that the top soil is quite firm, crop yields are low, fire danger is high, and well levels are continuing to decrease. Given the state of the drought, Minnesota’s Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis issued restrictions on water use. Though these restrictions were limited to how frequently residents water their lawns, the DNR has stated that the drought progressed to a threshold to trigger a “warning phase” to prepare citizens in case the situation worsens.

Wildfires on the west coast of Canada blew smoke 2,000 miles east, to the extent that air quality metrics measuring particulate concentrations hit record levels in regions across the state. Minnesota’s wildfire count had been on the decline from 2015-2019, but the continued drought poses a serious risk to increasing the severity of wildfires. 

Accessible water maintains the health of nearly every ecosystem in the state. Even where water is plentiful, there are still some health concerns caused by climate change. In June, the Carver Lake beach located in Woodbury was shut down due to the presence of blue-green algae. The bacteria’s name is a bit of a misnomer, the  “algae” is actually a harmful cyanobacteria that thrives in warm, nutrient rich waters. Periods of sustained high temperatures can encourage algal blooms that increase the concentration of the cyanobacteria. If the bacteria comes in contact with skin or is otherwise ingested, the toxins produced by the bacteria can cause vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, eye irritation, headaches, and a sore throat. For non-humans such as pets or waterfowl, blue-green algae can even kill. 

These worsening issues did not crop up overnight and they will not be addressed overnight either. One potential solution already in practice is protecting more land for DNR management.

25% of land in Minnesota is protected and managed by the Department of Natural Resources. This land is protected in the forms of state parks, local reserves, and wildlife management areas. With the creation of public lands managed by the DNR, 4100 miles of trails have been created for use within state parks, recreation areas, and forests.

For the majority of Minnesotans, outdoor recreation is an important part of their lives. Per the DNR, state parks and recreation areas attract nearly ten million visitors annually, which is a testament to the beauty of our state. Minnesota is also fortunate enough to have six National Parks that garner interest from the entire United States. 

From an environmental perspective, Minnesota’s protected land also makes sure that Minnesotans have access to clean water sources. 8% of the state’s area is covered with water, which is enough to provide drinking water to all residents. Additionally, the protection and management of 25% of the state’s land allows the DNR to uphold groundwater quality. 

With this in mind, the protection of water sources and management by the DNR is of critical importance to ensure the benefits of the land continue to be available.

The DNR’s protection of land in Minnesota also has economic benefits for the state. Under protected status, the DNR can regulate the sale of wood and maintain control of how much of our forests will contribute to forestry on an annual basis. This management yielded $1.6 billion USD in 2016 alone. Protection of forests contributes significantly to Minnesota’s economy, as does the sale of mining leases.

The most profitable activity our protected land supports is recreation, where fishing, hunting, and wildlife contribute $3.7 billion USD annually. Much of this money gets funneled right back into conservation efforts to maintain the health and protection of our lands.

The DNR has issued the following statement on climate change: “We have a responsibility to adapt to climate change. We manage the impacts of climate change and protect Minnesota's natural resources, ensuring outdoor recreation opportunities for future generations. We take seriously our contributions to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. We are investing in renewable energy, continuing our good stewardship of public lands, and limiting or offsetting greenhouse gas emissions.”

Through their continued efforts to preserve the balance of ecosystems across Minnesota, the DNR has the greatest understanding of the impacts of climate change and how to mitigate them. To support their efforts, most Minnesotans won’t have to change much of their own lifestyles. The majority of DNR funding in Minnesota comes from the sale of fishing and hunting licenses, so as long as those sales continue in normal amounts, the DNR will have the funds necessary to manage our lands. Furthermore, federal wildlife and fisheries grants in recent years have also made up a significant portion of the DNR budget.

Where citizens may be able to do more is on private land where the DNR is not able to access. In Woodbury, stormwater ponds are common features that collect and hold water, while also preventing debris from making their way downstream. These ponds act as buffers to maintain the health of larger bodies of water - but they also sustain life even if that was not the intention behind their creation. Frogs, turtles, birds, and small mammals rely on these ponds as an accessible water source, but when they are contaminated with trash and chemical runoff from over treated neon lawns, their health is going to suffer.  When it comes to maintaining water quality for wildlife in residential environments, minimizing lawn treatments where possible would be a benefit to the animals that subsist in stormwater ponds.

Minnesotans can continue to recreate and support the DNR and do their part to fight climate change at home. Raising awareness of climate issues, using renewable energy, composting, generally consuming less, and rethinking use of fossil fuel reliant vehicles are all great places to start.



 From Filmmaker and Guest Blog Author Arian Tomar: When I set out to make 10,000 Wasted Lakes, I never thought I would learn as much as I did through the process. Though I’ve outlined many initiatives both public and private that are making strides towards a healthier, more sustainable future for Minnesota, I think one thing that is just as important is to make sure that our climate stories get told. 

People are not natural born activists, climate scientists, conservationists, or land managers, but we are all natural storytellers. To tell a climate story, there is so much research that goes into it, but nothing is more moving than the human experience. We are past the time where people can stand by as climate change decimates our home so I don’t care if you don’t think you don’t have a part in this fight. We are all part of one story now, the story of how we beat climate change, and we need your voice to be part of it.

Have you ever dreamt of traveling to the deserts of Tatooine? Do you think your outdoor skills could take you far in the Hunger Games? Want to follow Rocky’s Siberian training regimen, one montage at a time? In this list, we explore seven iconic movie locations filmed in national parks, forests, and other public lands that you can go out and visit right now!
 
Seneca Creek State Park, MD - Photo Credit: G. Edward Johnson 


‘The Blair Witch Project’ (1999 | Horror)
Seneca Creek State Park, Maryland


Seneca Creek State Park is a different kind of overnight experience. Those who feel brave enough can explore over 50 miles of trails that the Blair Witch calls home. In past years, local rangers have hosted “Blair Witch Heritage Hikes” that take fans through some of the movie’s spookier sites.

‘The Hunger Games’ (2012 | Dystopian)
North Fork Reservoir &amp; Pisgah National Forest, North Carolina


This Reservoir houses the island that served as the starting location for the 74th Hunger Games. While the public cannot visit the iconic site of the cornucopia, the surrounding lands remain open for a full Hunger Games survival experience. To the Southwest, you can explore the same woods the protagonists grew up and refined their hunting skills in at Pisgah National Forest.

‘Star Wars: A New Hope’ (1977 | Sci-Fi)
Death Valley National Park, California


Although visiting a distant planet may not be achievable in the near future, you can take yourself on a makeshift trip to the desert planet of Tatooine in Death Valley National Park in California. This served as the home of Luke Skywalker, and was the place he received his first lightsaber. NPS.gov features a great list of some of the more accessible filming locations throughout the park.

‘Moonrise Kingdom’ (2012 | Comedy)
Fort Wetherill State Park, Rhode Island


New England gets the Wes Anderson treatment in this classic love story. Fort Wetherill State Park hosts the beach dubbed the ‘Moonrise Kingdom’ that the film is named after. This secluded spot just outside Newport, Rhode Island is a must for a romantic getaway - just make sure you let people know you’re leaving.

 


Bridger-Teton National Forest, WY - Photo Credit: Brett Stanton


‘El Camino’ (2019 | Drama)
Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyoming


Bridger-Teton National Forest plays the part of Jesse Pinkman’s dream destination of Alaska in this movie. The cold environment and the 3.4 million acres of public lands made it a perfect fit to film for the sequel to Breaking Bad - and a bit more cost-effective than filming on-site in Alaska, as the budget for this Netflix-only fan service epilogue was only $6 million. (In contrast, the average cost of production per episode of Breaking Bad was around $3 million each)

 

Hule'ia National Wildlife Refuge, HI - Photo Credit: Bret Robertson 


‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ (1981 | Adventure)
Hule’ia National Wildlife Refuge, Kauai, Hawaii



Indy’s great expedition in search of a golden idol was shot on the island of Kauai, including the famous scene of Indiana Jones fleeing from a boulder. The Refuge is currently closed to preserve endangered species, but the area can still be viewed from the Alakoko Fishpond. Other blockbusters filmed on the island of Kauai include Jurassic Park, Avatar, and Pirates of the Caribbean.

 

Grand Teton National Park, WY - Photo Credit: Chris Blake 


‘Rocky IV’ (1985 | Sports/Drama)
Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming


The iconic training montage from arguably the best installment of the Rocky franchise (best villain anyway) was not actually filmed in Siberia as the movie portrayed, but instead on location throughout Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. Silly Ivan Drago’s advanced training techniques in the gym proved to be no match in the ring for Rocky’s manhandling of the park’s innocent logs.

"Last year, the Great American Outdoors Act (GAO) was signed into legislation to allot up to $1.9 billion per year for five years to allow for necessary maintenance and upgrades in National Parks throughout the country. Now, the National Parks are finally beginning needed projects as the GAO has begun significant work."

(published 8/12/2021)

"About an hour into the morning’s hike, the smoke started to roll in. As I mentioned in my gear prep blog, I was well aware of the early fire season and had been dodging smoke from the nearby Tamarack Fire that sprung up to the south right before I had set out. Up until this morning, however, the more northern Dixie Fire hadn’t been a concern for the Tahoe area - until winds shifted unexpectedly and pushed the smoke into the basin. Within an hour, I couldn’t see across the lake, and barely even a few ridgelines over. The hikers I passed became fewer and farther between, and I was worried about spending the night in the worsening air quality."

Taken From: Trip Report: Ohlone Wilderness Trail 
(published 8/16/2021)

"The Ohlone Wilderness Trail is a difficult/strenuous backpacking trip with mostly moderate to steep terrain. For those in the Bay Area planning to attempt long distance thru-hikes like the Tahoe Rim Trail, the John Muir Trail or the Pacific Crest Trail, it is often referred to as the “training hike” due to the constant up-and-down nature of the trail. Most complete thru-hiking the trail within 2 or 3 days, starting at Del Valle Regional Park and finishing at Mission Peak in Fremont, CA."

(published 8/23/21)

"Additionally, the alpine terrain can make for unpredictable weather - so be sure to check in with a backcountry ranger before you begin for the latest forecast, and avoid any exposed areas if you see ominous clouds rolling in. With high-alpine terrain comes a short hiking season - due to snow, you likely won’t be able to safely attempt this hike outside of a short window between early August and mid September."

US Forest Service Closes Every National Forest in California

On August 30th, the US Forest Service announced that all National Forests in the state of California will be closed to the public until September 17, 2021. This announcement comes just prior Labor Day weekend, which historically has been an extremely busy time for National Parks and Forests throughout the country. The USFS cites an unprecedented wildfire season as the reason for this decision - with 1.7 million acres of forest already in ashes and firefighting resources throughout the state stretched to their absolute limit. Those responsible for this difficult decision hope that it will reduce the risk of people being endangered by these ongoing fires, as well as the likelihood for additional fires to break out.

Flooding Impacts National Parks Throughout Country - Widespread Trail Closures

While the droughts in the Northwest have led to record wildfire spreading, much of the rest of the country is being impacted by rainfall so severe it is causing flooding throughout neighborhoods, towns, and cities. Across the South and up the Eastern Seaboard, communities are facing dire emergency situations, and  flooded roads are complicating evacuation and travel logistics for many. Unfortunately, this phenomenon also extends to our National Park Service, with many parks throughout the country implementing closures of trails, parking areas, and campsites to mitigate damage caused by the storms and ensure the safety of visitors. If you’re planning to visit a Park this holiday weekend, be sure to check their website first to ensure your itinerary will not be interrupted.

Grand Teton National Park, Utah Parks Lower Fire Danger Rating to Moderate

Though climate change is certainly making its impact felt this season with the outdoor recreation community, not all is hopeless across the country. For the first time in what seems like months, Teton Interagency Fire has downgraded the Fire Danger Rating in Grand Teton National Park to “Moderate.” Even though two wildland fires are still actively burning within Park limits (in addition to two proscribed fires along the western edge of the park), the impact of rain and snow throughout the region over the past few days was sufficient to allow area vegetation to reattain non-critical moisture levels. Similar conditions throughout Utah have also led officials in that state to reduce fire restrictions throughout their Park system. Visitors are still reminded to be extremely conscious of any campfires, as this lowered rating does not prevent ignorance or neglect from causing the next great wildfire to break out.

Southwest Astronomy Festival to Commence September 10-12

National Parks and Monuments throughout the Southwest are offering a series of free astronomy programs, dubbed the Southwest Astronomy Festival, to visitors next weekend, September 10-12, 2021. Southwestern Utah and Northern Arizona feature some of the darkest night skies in the country, and are an ideal location for stargazing and learning about astronomy as a whole. The majority of events related to the festival will be hosted by Grand Canyon - Parashant National Park and Cedar Breaks National Monument, click the links for a full schedule of events.

Golden Gate National Recreational Area Looks to Implement New Fee Structure

Golden Gate National Recreational Area, which according to the NPS was the second most visited National Park in the country last year, is seeking public input to determine if visitors would tolerate parking and usage fees being introduced across many of the attractions of the region. The proposed fees represent a significant change, and come as a stark contrast to the dedication of the past to keep as many of these free of charge to encourage visitors from a variety of economic backgrounds. While the need for funding to support Park operations is certainly important, this may have a significant negative impact on the public accessibility of this area. You can make your voice heard on this issue until September 26th, 2021, by emailing goga_business@nps.gov or calling 415-561-4700.

Free National Park Entrance on National Public Lands Day - September 25

The National Park Service will be waiving entrance fees for every National Park in the country on Saturday, September 25th! This is to celebrate National Public Lands Day, a holiday held each year on the fourth Saturday of September that celebrates the amazing natural beauty of this country, and encourages visitors to give back by volunteering on ongoing restoration and improvement efforts at the Parks.

Trip Info:

Trip Type: Backpacking
Season: April 2021 (Spring)
Location: Antioch (East Bay), CA
Total Distance:  7.5 miles 
Elevation Gain: 1,200 ft
Duration: 2 days / 1 night
Trail Type: Loop
Permit: Required
Link: https://www.ebparks.org/parks/black_diamond/ 



Overview:

Hiking in the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve is considered to be easy to moderate overall. This overnight backpacking trip is a great way to get out and explore the various parts of the area. Located at the foothills of Mount Diablo, the trail offers rolling hills, ridges, tunnels and other historical landmarks. 

This region of the Bay Area was established as a Regional Preserve in 1976. It is the historical home of the Ompin, Volvon, and Julpun tribes. With the arrival of European colonists in the early 1700's, most of the land was converted to cattle ranches, until the establishment of the eponymous coal mines in the 1850's. From then until the early 1900's, coal miners as young as 8 years old were employed to extract nearly 4 million tons of 'black diamonds' from underneath these rolling hills. The area was later converted to sand mines before resuming its role as ranch lands from the 1940's until today.

The trail starts at the parking lot of the visitor center and park residence and traverses through small hills. There is water available at the campsite, however it requires filtration. I made a loop hike on this trip by taking the Railroad Bed Trail and Miners Trail to the campsite and taking the Carbondale Trail on the way back to the parking lot. I also hiked around and explored some tunnels past the campsite going toward Prospect Tunnel and Star Mine Group Camp.

Trip Planning:

Permits:

Backpacking permits in this area take the form of fees for parking ($5 per car, payable at parking lot kiosk), and fees for camping (see section below). Dogs are permitted (on leash) on the preserve's trails for a $2 fee per dog. 

Camping:

There are two backpacking campgrounds in the park: Stewartville Backpack Camp and Star Mine Group Camp. The fee for the Stewartville Backpack Camp is $5 per night per person. Reservations are required at least five days in advance, and can be made by calling 1-888-EBPARKS (1-888-327-2757). Star Mine Group Camp is reserved for 'organized, educational' groups only, so may be best avoided for backpacking adventures such as this one.

Itinerary:

Day 1: Visitor Center → Stewartville Backpack Camp

Drove to the visitor center and parked my vehicle. Took the Railroad Bed Trail to the Ridge Trail junction where my hiking buddy and I stopped for a quick lunch. Afterwards, we continued on the Miners Trail towards Stewartville Backpack Camp, where my hiking buddy headed back towards the car while I set up shop to camp for the night. There was an outhouse and one campsite, which required a reservation to utilize. Along the way, we caught views of the back side of Mount Diablo and Stewartville Township. 

Total Distance: 3.3 miles


Day 2: Stewartville Backpack Camp → Prospect Tunnel → Visitor Center

Woke up early around sunrise and made some quick breakfast before heading out for a hike to visit Prospect Tunnel. Though the first 200 feet of this pitch-black tunnel are open for exploration, I only went about half that far in before it became too dark to proceed any further - so I headed back towards came to pack up my equipment. Once back at camp, I packed everything up, and hiked out to the Ridge Trail junction. From there, I took the Carbondale Trail back to the parking lot and drove out - a slighty different route on the way out so I could explore even more of this beautiful region.

Total Distance: 4.2 miles

Local Scoop: Coyote Loop, an Underrated Hike in Marin County, California
A Hidden Gem of the North Bay with Breathtaking Views

Mount Tamalpias: Marin, CA - Photo Credit: Kate Bartschat 


Marin County, located to the North of San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge and through the Robin Williams Tunnel, is commonly considered to be one of the most beautiful regions of the country for good reason. From stunning coastal views in the Marin Headlands to alpine forests on Mt. Tamalpais, there is something for everyone. But when I say everyone, I mean everyone. Each weekend there is a mass migration from the city to Marin. If you are like me and prefer enjoying nature alone, this can be frustrating. Luckily, as a born-and-raised Marin-ite, I’ve had 24 years to find the path less traveled. 

One of my favorite under-the-radar hikes is a relatively easy hour-long loop in the Marin Headlands that I call the ‘Coyote Loop’. This hike offers beautiful views of Tamalpais Valley, Tennessee Valley, and the Pacific Ocean. It is also one of the few hikes in the Headlands that allows dogs. This hike is best enjoyed in the hours before sunset when you can watch the fog roll in. As with any outdoor adventure in the Bay, make sure to pack a layer!

Directions: 
This hike begins at the end of County View Drive in a quiet neighborhood (37.872490, -122.536036)  Because this trailhead is not well known, there is no parking lot. However, street parking is usually very easy to find. 

Begin walking on Miwok Trail, the sole path beginning at the trailhead. The trail gets its name from the Miwok, a Native American tribe indigenous to the Bay Area and Northern California. A large portion of the elevation change in this hike is at the very beginning, so don’t be afraid to power through this initial uphill climb. As you crest this hill, you will see Tamalpais Valley on your left. 

Continue on Miwok Trail until you reach the first junction. Take a slight left onto the path that borders a small valley to continue on the Miwok Trail. Note the chaparral biome (thick shrubbery) - plants here evolved to wick moisture from the evening and morning fogs. 

 Note: Stay alert on this hike, as mountain bikers often ride down this trail at high speeds

You should pass a large eucalyptus tree directly beside the path. These trees were brought to California by homesick Australian immigrants during the Gold Rush. This invasive species is a nuisance to locals as their shaggy, shedding bark poses quite a fire hazard. In their defense, the trees do smell really good! Follow the path until it transforms into a wide fire-road overlooking a heavily forested valley. 

At this second junction turn left to continue on the Miwok Trail. You should be heading in the opposite direction of the eucalyptus forest, deeper into the headlands. Continue until you reach a third junction.

At the third junction follow the signage for Coyote Ridge Trail, the path with a sharp incline. This is the second stretch of the hike with a hill, but it is certainly worth the view. Continue along this path as it wraps around a small peak.

At the top of this hill is a 360 degree viewing point:  the perfect place for a snack. From this spot you can get a clear view of Muir Beach, Mt. Tamalpais, and the Headlands. This is the halfway point of the hike! 

After a brief break, continue a short way along Coyote Ridge Trail towards the ocean. Keep your eyes peeled for a partially hidden path in the shrubbery on the left-hand side of the trail. Once you spot this small trail, leave the main road and follow the path which goes in the direction of the trailhead. This trail takes you along the edge of a steep valley through thick underbrush. 

Note: Coyotes can be active in this area. If you have a small dog, make sure to keep them on a tight lead

As you walk on this trail, you should pass a gray lichen-covered boulder resting above the shrubbery. Continue on the trail until it leads to a larger boulder, which locals (or at least my dad) have dubbed Haypress Rock for the campsite it overlooks. This is a great spot to find a seat and view Tennessee Valley below. As you approach Haypress Rock, you might be able to spot a porcelain bathtub hidden among the shrubs in the valley. Very mysterious.

Continue on the trail as it descends into deep shrubbery and emerges parallel to Miwok Trail. At the next junction, turn right to once again merge with Miwok Trail. Continue on Miwok Trail until you return to the trailhead.

And there you have it! A peaceful hike for the less socially inclined. Catching a view of the breathtaking coastline and formidable Mt. Tamalpais without a group of tourists is a rare gem in an area as busy as Marin! Enjoy the alone time... as Thoreau said: “I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.”

The Great Outdoors has long been a breeding ground for inspiration of all sorts. For creative-types, nature has spawned some of the greatest art this planet has ever seen - in music, photography, writing, paintings, and so many other forms of media. Even for those without a creative bone in their bodies, getting out into nature can help revive, refresh, and revitalize their psyche, grounding them in reality while also helping them to dream bigger - that great paradox of inspiration that must forever be chased. 

Often times that inspiration we feel creeping into our souls when we step outside is extremely difficult to express, to convey, to properly put into words. We know it when we feel it, but we don't know how to tell others exactly what it is that makes us crave it, chase it, embrace it with every bone in our bodies. Fortunately, some of the best writers and orators in history, who might be slightly better wordsmiths than ourselves, have provided us with a litany of quotes over the years to help explain that feeling nature brings to us whenever we find ourselves far enough away from everyone apathetic and everything so synthetic.

In honor of these great writers, and in honor of you, our readers, who work tirelessly to create opportunities to get out into the natural wonderlands you so love and revere, we've brought you 15 of our favorite outdoors-related quotes from history's great writers and orators. May they inspire you to hop in your car, flee civilization, get as far into the middle of nowhere as you possibly can, and commune with all that this beautiful Earth has to offer.

"Take only memories, leave nothing but footprints."
Chief Seathl

“Hiking is not escapism; it’s realism. The people who choose to spend time outdoors are not running away from anything; we are returning to where we belong.” 
Jennifer Pharr Davis 


“At some point in life the world’s beauty becomes enough. You don’t need to photograph, paint, or even remember it. It is enough.” 
Toni Morrison 


“Enjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive, and I promise you this much; I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies, over those desk-bound men and women with their hearts in a safe deposit box, and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this; You will outlive the bastards.” 
Edward Abbey 


“The antidote to exhaustion isn’t rest. It’s nature.” 
Shikoba

“And into the forest I go, to lose my mind and find my soul.”
John Muir 
“Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass...It's about learning to dance in the rain.”
Vivian Greene


“The wilderness holds answers to questions man has not yet learned to ask.”
Nancy Newhall 


“Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influence of the Earth.” 
Henry David Thoreau


"Believe one who knows; you will find something greater in woods than in books. Trees and stones will teach you that which you can never learn from masters."
St. Bernard de Clairvaux 

Zion National Park, UT - Photo Credit: Falco Rodriguez 


“Listen to the air. You can hear it, feel it, smell it, taste it. Woniya wakan—the holy air—which renews all by its breath. Woniya, woniya wakan—spirit, life, breath, renewal—it means all that. Woniya—we sit together, don’t touch, but something is there; we feel it between us, as a presence. A good way to start thinking about nature, talk about it. Rather talk to it, talk to the rivers, to the lakes, to the winds as to our relatives.”
John (Fire) Lame Deer

“Autumn carries more gold in its pocket than all the other seasons.”
Jim Bishop

"The Desert represents the place we all start; It is the beginning and the end of life."
Clarissa Pinkola Estes

“Some of us are drawn to mountains the way the moon draws the tide. Both the great forests and the mountains live in my bones. They have taught me, humbled me, purified me and changed me.”
Joan Halifax


“There is pleasure in the pathless woods. There is rapture on the lonely shore. There is society where none intrudes, by the deep sea and music in its roar. I love not man the less, but Nature more.” 
Lord Byron

Overview:

The Ohlone Wilderness Regional Preserve was named for the Ohlone Tribe that populated most of California's Bay Area for thousands of years before the onset of European colonialism. This time last year, nearly half of the area's 9,737 acres were impacted by the SCU Lightning Complex Wildfire - but as the video and photos show, the resilience of this chapparal biome allows for rapid regeneration of the region's plantlife less than 6 months after such devastation. 

The Ohlone Wilderness Trail is a difficult/strenuous backpacking trip with mostly moderate to steep terrain. For those in the Bay Area planning to attempt long distance thru-hikes like the Tahoe Rim Trail, the John Muir Trail or the Pacific Crest Trail, it is often referred to as the “training hike” due to the constant up-and-down nature of the trail. Most complete thru-hiking the trail within 2 or 3 days, starting at Del Valle Regional Park and finishing at Mission Peak in Fremont, CA. 

There are notorious sections like the “Big Burn,” which is a steep 1,100 ft climb spanning just over a mile. The steepest section of the trail is from Del Valle to Schleiper Rock. Most of the trail goes through rolling hills, with views of the surrounding cities. The trail also traverses through grazing land, seasonal Murietta Falls and peaks such as Rose Peak (at 3,817 ft, it’s the highest peak in Alameda County) and Mission Peak. 

During the summer, the hot temperatures make the trail difficult, hence a spring or late fall trip makes for more favorable hiking conditions. Water is available in certain campsites along the trail, however it requires filtration. I’ve traversed this trail multiple times, but on this trip I wanted to explore campsites I hadn’t stayed in before. However this time around, we unfortunately had to cut our hike short in Sunol due to incoming storms and the sun setting before we had a chance to complete the final 7 miles up and down Mission Peak.

Trip Planning:

Permits:

Permits are required for hiking the Ohlone Wilderness Trail, and separately for parking and camping as well. The trail permit is $2, and is valid for an entire year. Trail permits can be purchased online, or picked up in person - which comes with a map of the entire trail (including an elevation profile). 

Camping:

There are multiple campgrounds along the trail, most of which require some off-trail mileage to reach. Dispersed camping is prohibited in the Ohlone Wilderness, one must stay in a designated campsite - all of which require reservations. More information on backpacking campsites and reservations can be found here: https://www.ebparks.org/activities/camping/backpacking.htm.

Itinerary:

Day 1: Del Valle to Boyd Camp

We began our journey by driving to Mission Peak trailhead, where I left my vehicle parked. We then took a Lyft to Del Valle Regional Park, to the starting trailhead near Ardilla Group Camp. The gate was closed after the bridge due to COVID, so we had to walk an additional 0.5 miles to the trailhead. We had a quick lunch, and then hiked out to Boyd Camp where we camped for the night. There was an outhouse and two campsites, both of which required reservation via telephone. Along the way, we caught views of Del Valle as we climbed out and we stopped to refill water at Stromer Spring, which was about 0.5 miles before Boyd Camp.

Total Distance: 2.7 miles


Day 2: Boyd Camp to Maggie’s Half Acre

We woke up early before sunrise and hiked out towards the Big Burn. We missed a trail sign and ended up taking an incorrect trail for about 1.5 miles. We caught the sunrise at an overlook around the same time we realized we were off our trail. Once we made our way back, we saw where we missed the junction, and got back on the Ohlone Wilderness Trail. It was funny as I’ve done this trail multiple times before, and couldn’t believe we missed the blatantly obvious sign - happens to the best of us I suppose! We then made our way down a steep ravine to Williams Gulch, and began our slow climb up the Big Burn. Reaching Schlieper Rock, we took a lunch break and continued onwards toward Rose Peak. We stopped at Stewart’s Camp to refill our water, and carried on. Once we made our way up to Rose Peak, nearing the junction for Maggie’s Half Acre, I noticed an animal jump into the bushes - from what I gathered, it could’ve been a bobcat or mountain lion. We scouted for a bit at the top of the ridge to see if we could notice any further movement, but heard nothing else. We then made our way to our campsite for the night - Maggie’s Half Acre. There is water and an outhouse at this campground, located just behind Rose Peak. During the night the fog rolled in, which created quite a unique experience to step out into the fog. 

Total Distance: 8 miles


Day 3: Maggie’s Half Acre to Sunol

We began our morning with some breakfast, packed up our camp, and hiked up to Rose Summit. We then made our way towards Mission Peak via Sunol. We reached Sunol Backpack Camp in the late afternoon passing through Goat Rock and a lot of downhill hiking. We had a quick snack at Sunol Backpack Camp and carried on. By the time we reached the Sunol Visitor Center, the sun had already set and stormclouds were rapidly gathering over Mission Peak. At that point we were left with no choice but to forego the final 7 miles of the trail to Mission Peak, and instead headed down to the Visitor Center parking lot. From there, we had a friend come pick us up and drive us back to our car at the Mission Peak parking lot, thus concluding our journey. 

Total Distance: 11 miles

Tahoe Rim Trail Thru-Hiking: One Woman's Journey Cut Short by Wildfire
Thru-Hikers Across the Country are being impacted by a wildfire season run rampant

As I headed out on the Tahoe Rim Trail (TRT) for Day 1 of my 10-day thru-hike, I knew I would be in for 170 miles of long treks, beautiful views, and meeting fantastic people. I also was well aware that I had to “expect the unexpected.” In fact, I had already done so on the way to the trailhead - my start time for the hike had been delayed by an hour because the lady who was kind enough to shuttle me around the lake to my starting point that morning had to take a detour to drop off another hiker. No matter - I had plenty of hours left in the day to get my planned 18 miles done and still save time to stop to enjoy all the views!

The first few days were smooth sailing through the waterless eastern section of the trail. This part of the trip runs through the Carson Range in Nevada, and because of how dry of a year it has been, there were no natural water sources for 40 miles. I filled up twice during this section, once at a road crossing where hikers often drop jugs of water for themselves before they start the trail (which is what I had done), and second at a hand pump in a primitive campground that the trail passes through. Pumping the water turned out to be a fun team effort with the other hikers who stopped there, and it was interesting to compare trips and trail information with them.

Despite the long water carries, the views from 3000 feet above Lake Tahoe and the satisfaction of completing so many miles each day made the first three days of this trip one of the best backpacking experiences I’ve had! Several times, I would also weave in and out of the ridgeline, getting alternating views of the lake and Nevada’s Carson Valley. This was already the longest I had ever been out on a solo trip, and though I had to get used to not having conversation partners throughout the day, being able to go at my own pace and be completely in charge of my own itinerary was both thrilling and rewarding.

The fourth morning, I woke up ready to get on trail again. With a stop in town and only a 13 mile day ahead of me, I was pleased to get a later start and have a real breakfast at a cafe. The start of the trail was immediately steep, but I was motivated. I pumped the tunes, paused frequently for water breaks, and said a friendly “Howdy!” to each hiker I encountered.

About an hour into the morning’s hike, the smoke started to roll in. As I mentioned in my gear prep blog, I was well aware of the early fire season and had been dodging smoke from the nearby Tamarack Fire that sprung up to the south right before I had set out. Up until this morning, however, the more northern Dixie Fire hadn’t been a concern for the Tahoe area - until winds shifted unexpectedly and pushed the smoke into the basin. Within an hour, I couldn’t see across the lake, and barely even a few ridgelines over. The hikers I passed became fewer and farther between, and I was worried about spending the night in the worsening air quality. 

After a phone call with my ground team (aka Mom and Dad), who had been watching smoke and air quality reports, we determined it was best for me to backtrack about three miles into town for the night. I had friends coming the next day, and wanted to be ready to meet up with them for the portion of the trail that they had planned to come meet up and hike with me!  Even going downhill on the way back it felt like I was hiking through a smoke cloud, and when I reached town the opposite shore of the lake wasn’t visible at all. I looked back up at the treeline I had come from and saw the smoke hanging thickly, which on the one hand validated my decision to backtrack, but on the other was still frustrating. 

Somewhat defeated, I called the hotel and waited at the local beach for my room to be ready. As I was sitting there, a young lady came up to me and asked me if I was hiking the TRT. She was clearly a fellow backpacker and she invited me to hang out with her and her boyfriend, who she was traveling the trail with. I spent an hour getting to know them - hostel owners on the Appalachian Trail who came to California in the AT off-season to hike some of our long-distance trails and summit Mt. Whitney. However, with the smoke they had decided to lay up in town for the foreseeable future and spend their days floating the river, kayaking, and exploring restaurants. I was sad to leave them when my hotel room was ready, but had it not been for the unexpected shift in smoke patterns I wouldn’t have gotten to meet two of the coolest people I’ve ever encountered!

I was rejuvenated by the time my friends showed up the next day, and the smoke had cleared enough to proceed with our group hike as planned. After a night of takeout food and a real bed, I was ready to get back on trail and this time, with company! Even though I knew at this point I wouldn’t be able to finish the whole trail in one go because of the section I’d skipped for smoke, it was also somewhat freeing to not feel the pressure of having to finish it all this time around. As rewarding as it was to cover so much ground the first few days, I also knew I had been pushing right until sunset every night to make my planned miles. Even though I probably could have kept doing that through the smoke, my night in town had made me realize that I also wanted to make sure I was enjoying all the trail had to offer; as my mom had texted me: “Remember that this should still be a vacation for you!” Though my idea of vacation was indeed backpacking for days on end, it was also seeing all the views of the trail, having time to detour to cool vistas, and maybe even taking a day in town to actually touch the lake I was staring at from above so often. With that shift in mindset, I was more than ready to hop back on trail with the added support system of my friends. 

We only had five miles to trek before getting to our target camping area, so we took a leisurely pace and still found a lovely campsite with plenty of time for dinner. It was much more enjoyable to joke around with familiar faces before crawling into my sleeping bag for the night, and I was especially grateful to have others near me since we had entered the more bear-prevalent sections of the trail.

Despite our hopes that the skies would remain clear, we woke up to an AQI of 400 the next morning (on a scale that goes from 0-500, that’s a pretty bad rating). The sky was pinkish-orange, we could barely see the treeline one mountain ridge over, and we could smell a faint campfire scent as we cooked our breakfast. Our mantra of the day was “No new thoughts until…” We decided we wouldn’t make any decisions about air quality until after we’d eaten breakfast - “Well, we’ve got to eat no matter what we decide,” stated one of my co-hikers. There was no point stressing over bigger decisions until the smaller tasks had been done, which is how we motivated ourselves throughout the day. 

After breakfast the AQI had dropped to 200, which was still certainly at unhealthy levels, but the downward trend was promising and so we decided to hike on for 12 miles until we reached the road crossing at Barker Pass, where we could get a ride into town if the air hadn’t improved. Therefore: “No new thoughts until Barker Pass”. I would be lying if the three of us weren’t each secretly counting down the miles until the road crossing; each crest over a ridge that led to a smoke-blocked view was somewhat disheartening, and the steep uphill climb right out of our camp certainly didn’t help matters. We all remained positive however, and pushed out the 12 miles at a quick pace.

We only passed a few backpackers and a couple day-hiking women the entire time, which was also a sign that perhaps it wasn’t a great day to be on trail. Finally, the Barker Pass trailhead came into view! We all happily plopped down our packs and pulled out lunch food (“No new thoughts about moving onward until we’ve had lunch”). As I sat with my can of Trader Joe’s Dolmas, the two women we had passed on the trail also emerged. They pointed to their pristine white Audi and offered us a ride back to town if we wanted. My friends and I quickly looked at each other and at the very apparent lack of other cars at the trailhead, none of us wanting to be the one to make the final call on our hike. We all almost immediately stood up and told the ladies we would love a ride, apologizing for our grimy packs and selves. On the way back to town, we learned that one of the ladies lived right behind the cabin that my friends and I had parked our cars at- small world! She dropped us off and the three of us took a minute to finish lunch before texting our friend who owned the cabin to ask if we could spend the night there. He graciously agreed and we let ourselves in, rushing to be the first to shower off all of the sweat, smoke, and dirt. 

We ended up spending two days at the cabin hanging out, watching tv, and playing board games before going back home. The smoke had cleared up a bit, but I had decided I didn’t want to spend the rest of my trip dodging smoke and missing beautiful views. I flew home to Washington State to spend my last few days of vacation time hiking in smoke-free mountains and hanging out with family. While it hadn’t been close to the trip I had planned for, I felt so lucky to have had such a variety of experiences on trail and to have met so many amazing people. I am excited to have a project to work on too - I plotted out the remainder of the trail into three shorter trips that I hope to finish within the next year! I learned what I enjoyed in a long hike - some long mileage days, some time with friends - and I learned that I don’t need to finish the trail in one shot to feel like it was a successful trip. I really got the entire Lake Tahoe experience rolled into one trip: backpacking, lake time, exploring the local towns, and hanging out at a cabin! This was definitely not the trip I thought I’d have, but certainly one I have no regrets about and will never forget!

5 Outdoor Gourmet Chefs Making Magic By The Campfire
These 5 Chefs are Making Gourmet Meals in the Wilderness
Photo Courtesy of Alps &amp; Meters 

Cooking in the outdoors has traditionally focused on the simple, compact, and easily transportable,  and most camping recipes across the internet seem to be focused on these core concepts. Foods like eggs, sausage, and sandwiches often take precedence when we venture into the wilderness. Despite this, a growing trend of outdoor chefs has taken over the internet, bringing the allure of luxury cooking to the more simple outdoor space. 

Utilizing limited equipment, often only a simple pot and fire, viral chefs all over the world are creating delicious-looking meals against gorgeous wilderness scenery, and it’s no secret why these videos are so popular. Quiet ASMR-style audio is characteristic of the genre, contributing to the serene, comfortable feeling of watching these videos, and viewers get to watch as content creators craft complicated and often unexpected meals with limited resources. 

We’d like to highlight the ingenuity of 5 of these chefs, who successfully blend the primitive with the modern and bring the extravagance of restaurant cooking to the humble campfire. 


Slawek Kalkraut and Krzysztof Szymanski - @menwiththepot


Slawek Kalkraut and Krzysztof Szymanski, also known as @menwiththepot on TikTok, are some of the newest and most popular contributors to this trend. With 8.6 million followers on the platform, there is a good chance you’ve already heard of them. The Polish duo living in Ireland makes gourmet meals in the wilderness, yes, but they have the art down to a science. Impressively, every single aspect of their meals are homemade. Just in the video above, they make their own sauce by skewering tomatoes on a stick and roasting them over a fire, and make their own calzone dough using flour and oil. The result is something that not only looks extremely delicious but viewers can also tell just how complex the flavors are, as they get to watch every step of the way. 

@menwiththepot have also perfected that calm, ASMR-style mentioned above. Their videos include no music and instead feature the chopping of their knives on the cutting board or the sound of garlic simmering in the pan. This, we think, is what makes their videos so addicting and easy to watch. The quiet as you watch Slawek and Krzysztof masterfully cook allows you to be transported to the Irish woods in which they make their creations as you get to experience the simple joy of cooking in the woods - as opposed to the hustle and bustle of a crowded restaurant. The result is a series of videos that are both peaceful and impressive, that transport you to the comfort of the outdoors while allowing you to witness culinary mastery in action.
 
Karen Williams - Gritty Gourmet

Gritty Gourmet is an outdoor recipe page that is run by rock climber, freelance writer, and innovative chef Karen Williams. As the name implies, this project specializes in bringing Gourmet style to the Gritty world of outdoor adventure. Unlike other creators on this list, who showcase their talent, often forged through years of training and experience, and are meant to be awed at from afar, Gritty Gourmet strives to bring the luxury to the everyday chef. Don’t let the stunning photos on her page fool you - her recipes are easy to follow and not overly complex. The image below of her rolling dough with a reusable water bottle perfectly captures the ethos of Gritty Gourmet: using what you have on hand to create something spectacular. 

Karen has an extensive background of outdoor experience, including time spent as a Wilderness First Responder and outdoor guide, and although she doesn’t claim to be a nutritionist or outdoor expert, what she does bring to the table is a love of nature without sacrificing the luxury of indoor meals. On her website and Instagram page, Gritty Gourmet posts recipes that are not only accessible for the outdoors but are also plant based, include simple ingredients, and are adaptable to your lifestyle or specific day out. She also has several recipes that are high in protein or used to increase energy for outdoor adventures. Therefore, her recipes are accessible for anyone looking to up their game when it comes to outdoor cooking. We love her commitment to sustainable travel, too!
 
asondo - Outdoor Chef Life


YouTube personality and sushi chef Taku is the man behind Outdoor Chef Life, a different kind of cooking channel that he runs with his girlfriend and camerawoman, Jocelyn. Based in California’s Bay Area, Outdoor Chef Life showcases the diversity and beauty of the area’s sea life in his stunning sushi-making videos. What really sets the channel apart however, is the element of foraging. Impressively, Taku brings his audience along as he hunts for and captures live fish to include in his creations. Not only does this ensure the utmost freshness for his sushi, but also allows viewers to get an up-close look at the species of fish that go into each dish and the flavor profiles they constitute.

Outdoor Chef Life’s videos are gorgeous, high quality episodes that are easy to binge-watch, but what really makes his channel worthwhile is Taku’s personality. Each week, you can follow him fishing in his green canoe or cooking a new dish, and his passion for the outdoors and his craft is always there. If you like sushi, his extensive culinary knowledge and his willingness to create each dish from its most deconstructed beginning is as impressive as it is inspiring. Currently, the couple is posting videos from their life as they live in their van (a dream for many of us), travel across the U.S., and continue to showcase the beauty of sea life throughout the country.
 
Hasan Al-Abdullah - @food_handcraft


Hasan Al-Abdullah is a Lebanese chef, CEO, and outdoor aficionado. You won’t find many of his videos in English, but the beauty of his cooking transcends all languages. At first glance, his videos are typical of the genre. They have no sound and instead focus on the sounds of the chef’s movements and nature in the background. What sets Hasan apart however, is the level of extravagance that his meals take. To get his meals just right, Hasan will cook entire chickens on a skewer, dig huge holes into the ground to cook inside a trash-can sized oven, and much more. This combined with cooking in somewhat extreme settings, including making chicken over a moving lake, elevates his videos to an impressive level as Hasan seems to want to challenge himself in every video he posts. His recipes may not be quite as accessible as Gritty Gourmet, but his dedication to bringing luxury to the outdoors is impressive and his videos are supremely entertaining. 

The recipes at @food_handcraft are traditionally Lebanese Moroccan style but Hasan puts his own twists on them, combining dishes to create something completely new - such as using pineapple to make shawarma to create complex and distinct flavors. Although this channel specializes in Lebanese cooking, it also features takes on Mexican, Italian, and other cuisines from around the world.
 

Francis Mallmann


For our final featured outdoor chef on this list, we saved one of the most extravagant: Argentine chef Francis Mallmann. If you’re an avid foodie, you may have already caught him on season 1 of Netflix’s original series Chef’s Table. Francis Mallmann specializes in open fire cooking, constructing huge pits in the middle of the wilderness to achieve a charred taste and look to the food he cooks. For Mallmann, cooking is as much about the visual aspect, the art, and the ambiance as it is about the flavor. As a result of this philosophy, Mallmann’s cooking is quite extravagant. Him and his team of about twelve people go to extreme lengths to make meals from natural means. This could mean standing full lamb carcasses in a crucifixion style over a handmade curanto (a Chilean cooking pit), or fishing for and cooking salmon using a traditional Argentine technique: encasing and smoking it in naturally found clay.

Francis Mallmann has worked in some of the finest restaurants in France and Argentina, even winning the Grand Prix, one of the most prestigious awards in European cooking. He owns 9 restaurants across three continents, so it is somewhat non-traditional that he would step away from such an empire to return to such a bare-bones approach to cooking. But for him, this type of procedure is important. It is not entirely about the meal that is finally prepared itself, but how it is prepared as well. In crafting his meals, Mallmann preserves the dreams that characterize his childhood, and continues an ethos of working hard and keeping the passion alive. It is not satisfying, he says, to be complacent or comfortable in his career, but to be continuously experiencing new ambiances and cultures, to be constantly fine-tuning his craft. In doing such things outdoors, he preserves one message: to get out of your chair and go out.

"Utah's flash flood season began with a vengeance on Tuesday, June 29th, as powerful thunderstorms caused flash flooding to wreak havoc throughout the park and surroundings. Though no casualties have been reported in this recent episode, floodwaters rushing through the narrow slot canyons have proven to be deadly in the past."

"At some point throughout all this, someone will likely pull out a speaker or ask for music in the car, and you’re going to need something to capture the feeling you have - of the light hitting your face and warming your entire body, of relaxation and excitement, of simple joy. That's why we put together a list of our 15 favorite songs for the beach."

"While this trail of course requires a lot of planning and physical training (finding all the information and data to plan this trip took many weeks and lots of website-hopping! [Ed.: if only there was a company working tirelessly to develop an app that solves this problem!]), these resources allow hikers to attempt the trail at whatever speed or daily mileage they feel comfortable with."

Taken From: Overcrowding in the Outdoors: How Tech Can Help 
(published 7/19/2021)

"Yet the problem with overcrowding at National Parks and more environmental pollution points to a bigger, overarching issue: the lack of proper infrastructure in outdoor recreational resources. When embarking on an outdoor trip, new adventurers look to plan their day rather haphazardly, relying primarily on word of mouth to determine when, where, and how to go. If online research is done, it ends up in a view that is familiar to most outdoor recreationists: numerous open tabs, several random blogs, and an overload of information that is near-impossible to retain."

Taken From: Beginner's Guide to Best Camera Gear for Outdoor Photography 
(published 7/29/21)

"As you develop your skills as a photographer and an artist, you’ll begin to better understand what you need for your next lens. If, for example, you find yourself drawn to wildlife photography, you can start to look at longer lenses like a 70-200mm, or even a 100-400mm. Longer lenses permit you to photograph subjects from a greater distance - this is especially useful for photographing wildlife when you want to maintain a safe range between yourself and a wild animal."

National Parks Continue to Fight Overcrowding Problem

Last month, overcrowding in National Parks continued to be a serious problem, with many outdoor enthusiasts and newbies alike flocking to these natural spots in record numbers. This caused a plethora of problems, including traffic jams and bad visitor behavior that for many, ruined the experience as a whole. 

Now, over a month later, National Parks are still trying to deal with this issue. So far, the use of ticketed entry and reservation systems have proven to be effective, but this still frustrates locals and non-ticket holders who wish to enter the parks. Utah’s Arches National Park has decided to stop promoting itself in hopes of curbing tourism for now and other National Parks, including Acadia National Park, have prohibited private vehicles and have instead been utilizing shuttle systems to limit the amount of cars in parking lots. This has been effective in saving space, but is still an unrealistic solution without major funding. Because of this, Congress is negotiating a bill that would allocate funding for this cause - although the outcome is still up in the air. In the meantime, experts still recommend shifting focus to the lesser known natural areas in the U.S. while a more elegant solution is formulated.

National Parks will be Waving Entry Fees on August 25th

In celebration of the National Park Service’s 105th birthday, many National Parks will be offering free entry across the U.S.! You can look here to see which parks are participating! This is a great opportunity to plan a National Park trip you may not have done before. Along with this free entry day, U.S. National Parks will be offering in-person events inside the parks, as well as several online experiences for the entire month of August.

Voyageurs National Park to Host Events Series Celebrating Designation as International Dark Sky Park

Minnesota’s Voyageurs National Park is the latest to be designated as a Dark Sky Park, meaning it has an significant lack of light pollution  and will thus be protected by the International Dark-Sky Association for astronomical research and protection of nocturnal species. It also makes it an ideal spot for stargazing, which isn’t surprising considering Voyageurs’ potential to display the Northern Lights. 

To celebrate this designation, the National Park has organized a series of events from August 11th-13th that are free to the public. These events include educational programs such as The Life and Death of Stars, and Ojibwe Constellations Storytelling and Art - which presents an exclusive look into traditional Native American knowledge and stories about constellations. There will also be a viewing of the Perseid meteor shower, and more interactive activities such as Paint the Milky Way and various Night Sky Activity Stations. The 3-day event will conclude with a Star Party and Telescope Viewing in collaboration with the Voyageurs Conservatory.

Lisa Petit Becomes Cuyahoga Valley National Park’s First Female Superintendent 

Lisa Petit, 60, has had a career with Cuyahoga Valley National Park for over two decades and has finally been named superintendent, a position she called a “lifelong dream.” Petit began working with the NPS in 2000 as a wildlife biologist, conducting research on birds native to the U.S. and Latin America in order to better understand conservation efforts in these areas. For the next 20 years, she worked various positions at Cuyahoga Valley National Park, including Chief of the Resource Management Program and interim superintendent. This experience allowed her to learn about several activity branches in the park including science, engineering, designing, environmental compliance, and more. 

Superiors who promoted her said that she was a “strong leader” who, thanks to her experience, can “quickly transition into her new role.” Petit will now oversee all of Cuyahoga Valley National Park, as well as the James A. Garfield National Historic Site, and the First Ladies National Historic Site.

National Parks Begin Significant Restoration Projects Thanks to Great American Outdoors Act Funding
 Last year, the Great American Outdoors Act (GAO) was signed into legislation to allot up to $1.9 billion per year for five years to allow for necessary maintenance and upgrades in National Parks throughout the country. Now, the National Parks are finally beginning needed projects as the GAO has begun significant work. 

These projects aim to make Parks safe and accessible for all visitors, as well as preserve their natural beauty for years to come. Some projects that will get underway this month include the rehabilitation of the Tuolumne Meadows Campground in Yosemite National Park to improve campground roads, picnic areas, add storage for protection against bears, and other amenities as well. Another project will improve the Moose-Wilson road in Grand Teton National Park - including repaving and spot-widening to improve safety. 

Unnecessary structures will also be removed in Shenandoah National Park to make room for the restoration of natural conditions in the area. You can see the rest of the GAO’s projects to restore and preserve America’s natural treasures here.

Wildfires and Dry Conditions Threaten National Parks, Cause Temporary Closing of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park
 This Summer, several wildfires have caused problems for our National Parks, including a whopping 35 fires within Yosemite in this calendar year alone. On July 29, lightning storms ignited at least five wildfires in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park in California. Although these events may seem catastrophic, they actually aren’t very uncommon as National Parks across the Pacific states are naturally fire-adapted ecosystems. 

However, the real problem is a lack of ample rainfall to regulate these ecosystems, and this concern has stretched from the Pacific states all the way to Hawai’i as rainfall around Eastern Hawai’i has been scarce as well. To combat these concerns, Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park has initiated road closures at parts of Mauna Loa Road and Hilina Pali Road. Officials have also banned open fires at the Nāmakanipaio campground until further notice. Propane and gas stoves will still be allowed, and guests will still be able to travel to the park on foot and bicycle while park officials continue to monitor safety concerns.

Denali National Park Hosting Annual ‘Need for Seed’ Event
 On August 8th at 9 a.m., Denali National Park and Preserve will be hosting its “Need for Seed” event, a day in the park to facilitate revegetation projects in the park, and teach the public about how native plants preserve the natural ecosystem. Guests are encouraged to visit and learn about the park’s plant life, but volunteers are also needed to collect and dry seeds for these projects. Volunteers will receive all materials and instructions on how to identify all plants, and in return, all volunteers will receive a special gift from the NPS!

Photography is a great hobby, and pairs well with exploring parks and wilderness. However, many people can feel intimidated by the overwhelming number of equipment options that are available, and have no idea where to begin. I’ve been taking photographs professionally for over 25 years and have used a wide array of cameras and accessories, so I put together a guide for how to start your photography journey based on my experience.

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of what options are available and what to purchase I have a few guiding principles to go over, and some terminology to define. 


Guiding Principles

The absolute best camera is the one you have with you. If you buy something big, heavy, or hard to travel with, you often won’t have it with you when you need it. There are times when your iPhone is the best camera because that's all you are able to carry. 
Gear is a far second to composition. Everyone likes to talk about specs and what is new and shiny, but the truth is that great photos have been taken, and printed quite large, with 10 megapixel cameras from 20 years ago.  Focus on framing, the elements in a sense, learning to see with a “photographic eye.” Time spent learning composition will pay greater dividends then any gear you might purchase, at least initially. 
Learn how to process your photos. Every great image you see these days has likely undergone a fair amount of post-processing work. Everyone has some opinion on how much editing is too much. You need to find your own style and a way to develop it after the photo is taken.

Camera Terminology

There are many specifications and so much technical jargon in the digital camera world. However, only a few are pertinent to this particular discussion. I’ll try and make this as painless as possible and include links at the bottom of this blog for anyone who wishes to dive deeper into any of the topics I’ve covered. 
Megapixel - short for “one million pixels,” this is a measure of the size of the image a camera produces. Anything greater than 15 megapixels is going to be great for the web (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and will print well up to 20x30 inches. The more pixels you have, the larger you can print, and the more flexibility you’ll have to crop your photos down and still have enough for sharing or printing. 
Full-frame vs. crop sensor - “Full-frame” means the physical size of the digital sensor is 35mm; the same as a traditional film camera. A “crop sensor” is smaller than 35mm. This does not in any way impact the quality of the images. Since a “crop” sensor is smaller, the cameras themselves are lighter and smaller than their full-frame counterparts as well.
Crop sensors and focal length - The focal length of a lens is the distance between the lens and the image sensor when the subject is in focus, usually stated in millimeters (e.g. 18mm wide, 50mm standard or 100mm telephoto). If your sensor is smaller than 35mm, the effective focal length is going to change. In other words, in Fuji cameras you have a 1.5 “crop factor” - meaning a 50mm focal length lens on a Fuji will give you a 75mm effective focal length. 
“Kit” lens - Some cameras come with a bundle of both the camera body itself and a starter lens; this often comes with a discount in price vs buying them separately. 

Now that all that is out of the way, let’s explore some options of what a good starting kit is going to look like. These are just my opinions, based on my experience - there are really no right or wrong answers. I have no affiliation with any of the links included here.

Camera Option 0 - Free! 

Since almost all of us have Smartphones, we can learn to take amazing photos with them! Check out this article written by my good friend, photographer Aaron Bieber, to find out how. 

Camera Option 1 - Beginner and Intermediate

Fujifilm X-T4 with the 16-80mm lens - $2,200

This is an amazing camera. It takes wonderful photos, and has spectacular color accuracy.  It is a 24 megapixel APS-C camera with in-body stabilization, and can also take 4K video. Best of all, Fujifilm cameras have almost all manual dials, which is an easy way to learn and understand how changing settings can affect your photos. 

The included 16-80mm lens is almost criminally good for the price. It is sharp edge to edge, has very limited vignetting, and goes from very wide to relatively long. If you had to start with one lens, this one would be it.

Note that this camera has an APS-C sensor, which means it's a little smaller than a “full frame” camera’s sensor. 

Camera Option 2 - Budget Friendly 

Fujifilm X-T1 with the 18-55m F2 lens - ~$450-$650 used (Ebay, Facebook Marketplace, or LensAuthority). 

You guessed it, this is the early version of the X-T4. It’s a 16 megapixel APS-C camera with a stunning 18-55mm kit lens. You can find these used for under $700 dollars - an incredible value. Yes it's older, and lacks some of the new features of current cameras, but if your goal is to learn how to take photos with a more advanced camera this is a great option. 

This kit lens at 18-55mm gives you a little bit less reach (how far it will zoom) then the lens recommended with the X-T4 above. You may consider this a limitation or you may view it as a way to make you think about where you stand, what you have in your frame, and think more about the picture before you take it. 

There are many other used cameras out there that are all great to learn with. However, I believe for a price vs features comparison the FujiFilm offers an unmatched value proposition. 

Camera Option 3 - Ideal Setup

Sony a7R IV - $2,998

This is truly a top of the line camera, but with the recent drop in price there may be some beginners who want to start towards the top. The a7R IV is a 61 megapixel full-frame camera that can also do 4K video. This camera offers a number of benefits over the lower cost Fuji systems including higher resolution, dynamic range, and the autofocus system which offers more autofocus points and is faster. 

Sony offers a huge array of lenses from very cheap to very expensive. Keep in mind that with 61 megapixels, due to such high resolution lower cost lenses are going to show every imperfection of the glass. If you're buying into this system be prepared to pay a little extra. 

There are a variety of options, but an ideal starting lens for this camera would be the Sony 24-105 f/4 lens, for about $1,098. It's wide (though not super wide) and gives you a good amount of “reach.”

General Note About Lenses

If you're just starting out, the lenses listed above are all wonderful choices. As you develop your skills as a photographer and an artist, you’ll begin to better understand what you need for your next lens. If, for example, you find yourself drawn to wildlife photography, you can start to look at longer lenses like a 70-200mm, or even a 100-400mm. Longer lenses permit you to photograph subjects from a greater distance - this is especially useful for photographing wildlife when you want to maintain a safe range between yourself and a wild animal. 

Camera Bags
Camera bags come in all shapes and sizes for all occasions. The choice of the right bag really comes down to how much you have to carry, and how you want to carry it (shoulder bag, backpack, even a rolling bag). Almost all camera bags offer good enough protection for your equipment - most people are amazed at how resilient modern cameras are. Though it's a highly personal choice, here are some general recommendations: 

ThinkTankPhoto - makes a wide array of bags of the highest quality. You cannot go wrong with any of their products. 

Shimoda Designs - makes, in my opinion, the best bags for backpacking with camera gear. They are insanely comfortable, and allow you to carry more than just photography equipment.

 What's in Chris' Camera Bag?

Sony A7r IV with 24-70mm 2.8 Lens
FujiFilm X-t4 with 55-140mm 2.8 Lens
Sony 135mm 1.8 Lens
Flashlights, spare batteries, cleaning kits, memory cards, etc
 
Tripods
This is the one area where I will tell you to buy the best one you can afford. Many photographers start cheap, outgrow the cheap tripod and buy the next level up. A few years later they have spent more on several levels of cheap tripods than they would have on one good one. 

What kind of tripod you will need is a bit tricky, and depends on what type of photography you want to do. If you're going out on camping trips or long backpacking treks, your focus may be more on weight. If you're trying to take pictures on top of a mountain or in otherwise rough conditions, you’ll want the most sturdy tripod possible. 

Important considerations when purchasing a tripod:
How tall can the tripod extend?
How much does the tripod weigh?
How much weight can you put on the tripod?

Below are three brands of tripods that I have used. They are all very good and come at a range of different price points. Each brand offers an array of different models, from super sturdy and tall to a bit shorter and very light.
Benro - Very budget friendly and well made -  $200-$500 
FLM Tripods - Pro grade gear, made in Germany - $400 - $900
Really Right Stuff - Buy it for life, made in the USA - there is nothing better - $850-$1300+

Tripod Heads
With each tripod brand listed above you're going to need a tripod head. This is the connecting piece between the tripod and your camera.  In my opinion, there is only one option here and that is the Really Right Stuff line of ball heads.  They are made with thought and care in the United States. They are strong, lightweight, offer precision operation, and will work for decades even under heavy use or even abuse.  Buy it once and just be done.

Really Right Stuff has an array of options, but for all the cameras listed above the BH-40 Ball Head would be a very strong option at $415. 

Keep in mind you’ll need one additional item to put all this together: a “plate” or an “L-bracket” that attaches to your camera and connects to the ball head. 

Memory Cards

You’ll need a memory card for your camera to store the photos you take. There are a lot of options out there, and the pricing keeps getting better. If you're not taking video or shooting action then you’ll be fine with a slower speed card.

I’ve been using the SanDisk cards since I started using digital cameras. They seem to work well and are very cost effective. You can get the SanDisk 512GB Extreme Pro UHS-I card right now for $130. 

Two Memory Card pro tips:
Buy more capacity in the cards than you think you’ll need. It is cheap enough, and you don’t want to run out of storage space while out in the middle of nowhere.
If your camera supports two cards, use two cards simultaneously. While they almost never fail, you don’t want to lose all your photos from your trip because of one bad card.

Editing Software 

Taking the photos is only the first step in the process - you still have to do something with all those amazing images once you get home. There are so many options out there, but for my money nothing beats Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. If you're just starting out, this is your best bet. Yes, Photoshop and other software might let you do some things that Lightroom won't, but here is my case for starting with Lightroom:
It’s a great photo editing / developer tool, and there are a million blogs, articles, and YouTube videos that can take you from novice to expert relatively quickly.  It is more than powerful enough to fully transform your images. 
It is the best photo catalog on the market. Period. There is nothing better for importing and organizing your photos. It will let you create folders and virtual collections, and you can tag with keywords, colors, and stars. You can also easily export photos for sharing on social media, the web, and printing. The software will even allow you to do a book layout. 
You can never outgrow it. Even if you become a pro and start editing in Photoshop using a dozen other 3rd party plugins, you’ll still need a way to manage all your photos. Using Lightroom as a “base” and exporting/re-importing is a breeze.

Best Places to Buy Cameras:
My go to is always BHphoto or Adorama; they offer amazing customer service, and have real experts available to help. I would highly recommend them over Amazon for any purchases and they are almost always competitive with pricing. LensRentals and LensAuthority are great places to rent camera equipment, and to purchase well-cared-for used gear.

Closing Thoughts

If you have made it this far then I’ll give you my best piece of advice: whatever camera you have, the most important thing is to use it! Get out there and experiment, try new things, go out at night, or sunrise, or any time of the day or night. Getting out the door is half the battle, the rest is just fun.

3 Levels of Camping Breakfast Recipes
For Pre-Planners, Rookies, and Campfire Aficionados 
Breakfast in the Mountains - Photo Credit: Laurine Bailly 
 

We all know that breakfast is essential - especially when you’re waking up bright and early, ready to conquer a 10-mile hike. But for many of us, we get too wrapped up in whatever we’re doing for the day that we forget to prepare for what’s supposed to be the most important meal. On the other end of the spectrum, some of our seasoned campers may be tired of making the same tried and true breakfasts that deliver every time, but may not be quite as appealing after a few dozen camping trips. Whatever outdoor cooking level you find yourself at, we’ve got you covered. Whether you like to plan ahead and forget the rest, stick to the easy classics, or want to test your skills and make something extraordinary, these recipes are what you need for your next outdoor excursion.


--The Premade--

 This section is for our go-getters, our big planners. The ones who don’t have time to sit around poking the fire before their daily adventure - they’d rather be watching the sun rise. For people like you, here are 3 minimal-ingredient meals that you can prepack before your next destination and whip up quickly before you start your day. Some require a bit of cooking, but for the most part, these meals only require a small bit of time and energy before you hit the trails. Be sure to check out our homemade trail snacks for even more recipes you can make before your trip!


Crumpets

This first recipe is from @timeshare_travellers on Instagram, and is super simple and easy if you’re craving something sweet. It only uses a few ingredients, so it’s a cheap and easy-to-remember recipe too! You can pack these crumpets to go for a snack while you hike, or eat them for your morning breakfast before heading out. Either way, this recipe is super easy if you can’t be bothered to make a full course meal before sunrise!

Ingredients: 
1 cup self rising flour
1 egg
Pinch of sugar
Milk (approx. ½ cup)
Ziploc bags
Maple syrup (optional)

Instructions: 

First, mix the flour, egg, sugar, and milk together in a bowl, and pour into a Ziploc bag. Mix well. At this point, you have ready-to-use batter to store and bring with you to cook over the fire at your convenience. To do this, cut a corner of the ziplock bag to turn it into a piping bag. This cuts down on dishes and makes it much easier to place on your skillet. Grease your pan and heat it. Then, pipe your crumpets onto your pan. Bite sized pieces are traditional, but you can make larger crumpets if you prefer. Heat until the dough bubbles and then flip. When they are golden brown, they’re done! Let cool and top with maple syrup.


Breakfast Burritos

We get it. The idea of a breakfast burrito sounds like a lot. They usually involve a lot of ingredients and can feel overly complex. Luckily, these breakfast burritos can be made at home and frozen for when you’re ready to eat in the morning. Just set aside a bit of prep time before your trip and you’ll have a hearty, protein-filled meal that will please anyone in your camp, while saving you time. Just make sure you have something to heat your burritos on, like a pan or camp stove, and these burritos will be delicious, hot, and ready for you to eat in the morning!

Ingredients: 
Large flour tortillas
2 potatoes peeled, chopped, cooked
Bacon or sausage
Eggs scrambled (about 2-3 per burrito)
Cheddar cheese, grated
Pinch salt &amp; pepper
Green onions, sliced
Salsa or hot sauce (optional)
Sour cream (optional)
Cilantro

Instructions: 

Before arriving at your camp, scramble your eggs with salt and pepper. Then, cook your sausage or bacon in a skillet as well as your potatoes until they are soft and warm. Set aside. Spoon both ingredients into the center of your tortillas. Add shredded cheese. Roll up your tortillas and wrap them in tin foil. To freeze effectively, place each burrito in a single layer on a baking sheet so each one freezes evenly. When you are ready to pack them, simply store them in a gallon-sized zip-loc bag and travel with them in your cooler.
When you arrive at your campsite and are ready to eat, cook on your pan for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is fully melted. Add any toppings now to ensure freshness and enjoy!


Overnight Oats

If you’re a veteran camper, it’s likely that you’ve had overnight oats in some way or another since they’re just so easy and versatile. There are a ton of overnight oats recipes online, with some great flavors (including apple pie), but we’ll just show you how to make a basic one here.

Ingredients: 
⅓ cup Rolled oats
½ cup Milk (add more for a lighter consistency)
¼ cup Yogurt
1 tbsp Chia seeds
Drizzle of Honey
Few drops of Vanilla

Instructions: 

Before your trip, mix all your ingredients together in a jar. Place the jar in the fridge and let it sit for at least two hours, although overnight is best. When your jar is done settling, take it out and add toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, peanut butter, or anything else you can get your hands on. Seal and bring to camp. You can eat these oats cold or hot!

 

--The Easy Campfire Meals--

 We know you. You want a breakfast that’s satisfying and you don’t mind poking the campfire for a little while, but you still don’t want to sacrifice convenience. Lucky for you, these recipes are simple and classic without sacrificing great flavor. You’ll only need a pan or pot for all of these recipes and you can throw these together in just a few minutes! 


Breakfast Sandwiches

We’re starting this section off strong with a total crowd pleaser. Everyone loves breakfast sandwiches, and with an assortment of ingredients you can make something that’ll satisfy almost anyone. I first had breakfast sandwiches like these out in the wild on a particularly rainy day during a camping trip in upstate New York with a bunch of my buddies. About four of my friends took the liberty of “taking our orders” while we sat around under a tarp, insisting that they had “everything”. They then disappeared for about twenty minutes, forming what they called an “assembly line” and making sure everything was cooked right. By the end, everyone got a sandwich that they loved and it was a perfect way to start the day!

Ingredients: 
Kaiser rolls, bagels, or your preference of bread
Eggs (1-2 per person)
Butter
Your choice of meat (optional)
Salt and pepper
Cheese slices (optional)
Ketchup or hot sauce (optional)

Instructions: 

Start by heating up your pan and melting some butter onto it. Wider pans work best for this recipe, because you’ll be working with a lot of ingredients at once, but you can always make each piece of the sandwich separately if you need to. After you melt your butter, place your breakfast meat onto the skillet and cook until golden brown. I like to cook the meat first if needed because it holds up better when placed on the side for a couple minutes. If possible, I’d recommend cooking the meat and eggs together - it streamlines the whole process, and cooking them together allows the flavors to marry in the pan. Season with salt and pepper. About halfway through your cooking process, cut your bread in half and place it on a free space on the pan as well, adding more butter if needed. Toast your bread for a couple minutes before taking it off the heat. Then, stack everything into a sandwich and enjoy!


Egg in a Hole

Next up is one of the all-time easiest breakfasts to cook on a skillet. The best part is you can cook it all together. The bread gets buttered in the pan while being toasted, so the entire piece of bread is flavorful and moist, and the egg stays put as you can eat, so you can carry it with you if needed. This is a great way to get a balance of carbs and protein to start your day and the cook time of a couple minutes can’t be beat!

Ingredients: 
Your favorite type of bread
1 Egg per slice of bread
Butter
Salt and Pepper to taste
Cheese slices (optional)

Instructions: 

 Melt butter and spread it around your pan. While you are waiting for it to melt, make a hole in the middle of a slice of bread by placing a glass or cup over it and pressing down. Use a knife to carve out the hole if necessary, and you should be left with a near perfect hole. Place your bread on your pan and let it toast lightly for 1-2 minutes, depending on your preference. Then, crack an egg inside the hole. Season with a little salt and pepper. Let the bread and egg cook together, flipping when the egg is firm on the bottom. Let cook for 1-2 more minutes, depending on how runny you like your eggs. Place a slice of cheese on top if you’d like. Then you’re done! You’ll be left with a perfectly cooked egg and a nicely toasted and already buttered piece of toast. If you kept the piece of bread that was left when you cut your hole, you can dip it in the runny egg too. Or top with jam or ketchup for extra flavor!

This breakfast is the cream of the crop of the easy camping breakfast lineup because it represents one of the core tenants of the outdoor spirit: resourcefulness. That’s right, with some leftover sausages from last night’s dinner and a little determination, you can cook up a one-pot breakfast that’s hearty and delicious. This is great if you don’t want to put too much thought into every single meal, or don’t have a ton of backpack space. This recipe is a great way to get use out of all your supplies!

Ingredients: 
Sausage
Butter
Eggs
Vegetables
Diced potatoes
Whatever else you may have leftover from previous campfire meals!

Instructions: 

First, butter your pan. Then begin frying your potatoes. Fry for a couple minutes, until soft (and edible!). Then, add the rest of your ingredients. Leftover sausage, veggies, eggs. Whatever you have on hand. If you ate it last night, it’ll be great in the morning - just add eggs and dinner becomes breakfast! Stir together, fry for a couple minutes and enjoy!

 

--The Advanced--

Finally, the section we’ve all been waiting for. These recipes are not for the faint of heart. Their ingredient lists are long and often require a lot of attention to perfect. They’re not super quick or easy and they’ll require some foresight. But if you want to test your skills, or just have the urge to cook like you're on Chopped even when you’re miles into the woods, these recipes from some of our favorite Instagram campfire cooking accounts to follow pack in a lot of flavor and are sure to impress. 

Hearty Apple Berry Oatmeal

Our first advanced recipe comes from Instagram user Kelly Duffin, and is the healthiest recipe on our list! Plus, it’s vegan! Unlike the other recipes in this list, this recipe is best made on a camp stove rather than over a fire, so you’re going to want to bust out the ‘fancy’ equipment. Now, this recipe may not look too complicated at first - it is just oatmeal after all. But as the name suggests, this hearty apple berry oatmeal has a lot of flavors to showcase. Free oats take this dish a step above your usual oatmeal from the box, and the assortment of fruits and spices makes it unique. Feel free to make this recipe according to your own preferences however. Replace apples and blueberries for whatever fruits you may have, or replace pumpkin pie spice with your favorite sweet seasoning. Whatever you do, this recipe is a great baseline for gourmet outdoor oatmeal, and it's a great source of energy for whatever day you have ahead. 

Ingredients: 
Free Oats
1 Heaping tbsp Chia Seeds  
Pumpkin Pie Spice to taste 
Liquid Stevia to taste 
1/3 Cup Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk  
1/3 Cup Water
1/2 Granny Smith Apple - Chopped  
1 tbsp Unsweetened Natural Almond Butter  
1/4 cup Blueberries 
2 tbsp Chopped Walnuts
1 tbsp Hemp Hearts 

Instructions: 

First, make your oatmeal by combining the oatmeal, chia seeds, almond milk, and water. Stir to combine. Then, turn your burner on high and place your oatmeal into a sauce pan over it, stirring occasionally as it cooks. While your oatmeal is cooking, begin chopping up your apples and place them in a bowl with your blueberries. Also add your almond butter, chopped walnuts, and hemp hearts into the bowl. Then, add your stevia and pumpkin pie spice to the pot, stirring continuously. Finish cooking your oatmeal until it reaches  your desired consistency. Add water if it gets too thick. Then, scoop everything into the bowl and stir everything to combine all the ingredients. 


Shakshuka Hash

This Israeli dish from Jen Chiles (On Instagram: @thekumquatkitchen) gives you a great mix of everything (Shakshuka quite literally means ‘all mixed up’) and is a healthy, delicious way to get your protein, carbs, and veggies in before you start your day - plus it’s vegetarian, too! Shakshuka sauce is a light tomato sauce, usually containing peppers and onions. It’s a staple of Israeli cuisine and although it can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, we love this particular recipe’s incorporation of hash browns to make a hearty morning meal!

Ingredients: 
1 bag frozen hash browns
1 Shakshuka starter (we recommend this one)
Eggs (2-3 per person)
Oil
1 avocado
Any vegetables of your choosing

Instructions: 

Start by frying your eggs, seasoning them as you like. How many is up to you, but we recommend 2-3 per person depending on how hungry you are. Then, set them aside. Oil your cast iron skillet and cook the hashbrowns, pushing them down into the bottom of the pan. Pour shakshuka sauce over the hashbrowns and top with your eggs, avocados, and veggies. Take off the grill and serve!


Hollandaise Sausage Scramble

This recipe is the final one on our list for a reason - it’s because it’s one of the most ambitious outdoor breakfasts we could find! This recipe from Michelle Brooks (@saskcamper on Instagram) is a take on the cook-a-bunch-of-stuff-in-a-pan genre of outdoor cooking, but is much more intricate. The sausage and hash browns make for a great classic breakfast, but this recipe adds quite the twist. The kicker? The homemade hollandaise sauce, which, although time consuming, adds a tanginess that will jazz up your meal and give you that zesty feel you may be missing from home. We do recommend you pre-make your hollandaise sauce beforehand, as it might be a bit tough to find a place to plug in a blender deep in the middle of the woods - but once made you can put it on just about everything. Remember, this recipe is not for the faint of heart, but if you have time, space, and a passion for unique luxury cooking, this might just be the place to start!

Ingredients: 
1 bag frozen Hash Browns, or diced potatoes
Eggs
Milk
Sausage patties
Tomatoes and green onions

Hollandaise Sauce Ingredients: 
3 egg yolks
½ cup melted salted butter
Pinch of mustard
Black pepper
1 tbsp lemon juice

Instructions: 

First, make your hollandaise sauce. We recommend pre-making this beforehand and packing it in sandwich bags. To do this, mix together the egg yolks, mustard, pepper and lemon juice and place in a mixer or blender. Slowly add very hot melted butter and mix until thick and smooth.

Next, warm up some butter in your frying pan. While it heats up, cut up your potatoes and place them in the pan with salt to season. Cook until potatoes are soft. Then, place your sausage in the pan and fry it until browned. Set aside. Begin cooking your eggs by whisking them together with milk and scrambling. When all ingredients are cooked, layer your hashbrowns, sausage, and scrambled eggs on top of each other. Drizzle hollandaise sauce on top and garnish with chopped tomatoes and green onions.

Overcrowding in the Outdoors: How Tech Can Help
With millions of additional Americans participating in outdoor recreation in 2021 and beyond, modernized infrastructure and informed beginners will prove essential to the health of our wildest natural places

In search of physical and mental escape amid COVID-19 restrictions, record numbers of people have been adventuring into the outdoors. In just the past year, 80% of Americans have engaged in outdoor recreation during the pandemic, 32% of which reported doing so for the first time. This is great news—people are rediscovering a passion for the outdoors in unprecedented ways, creating a new wave of adventurers. 

However, this ongoing trend introduces some concerning challenges to the well-being of our natural resources. The high numbers of new adventurers—millions and millions of extra participants in camping, hiking, and freshwater fishing—in addition to the rapidly growing effects of global climate change, make it crucial that participants understand how to protect themselves, others around them, and our environment. 

Struggling to keep up with skyrocketing demand, National Parks like Yosemite, Glacier, and Rocky Mountain have implemented reservation systems to restrict visitations and allow the park grounds to recover. Others that have yet to introduce such a system end up seeing hours-long lines to enter (if you even make it in, as some like Arches National Park in Utah reach full capacity even before 9 a.m.!). Residents that live near these sites are understandably upset at the sudden changes taking place around them: increased pollution, dumped human waste around their community, vandalism, illegal parking, illegal camping, and damaged grounds are only some of many stressors they face. Efforts have certainly been made to maintain these grounds, with states like New York establishing programs to recruit volunteers to eliminate trash at trailheads and Oregon cleaning trash and biohazards from 67 of its Portland-area campsites earlier this year. Yet when faced with an overwhelming amount of new adventurers amidst cuts to park staff and budgets, it is clear that the existing infrastructure of the outdoor recreation community cannot sustain this trend without the assistance of those who enjoy it.

Yet the problem with overcrowding at National Parks and more environmental pollution points to a bigger, overarching issue: the lack of proper infrastructure in outdoor recreational resources. When embarking on an outdoor trip, new adventurers look to plan their day rather haphazardly, relying primarily on word of mouth to determine when, where, and how to go. If online research is done, it ends up in a view that is familiar to most outdoor recreationists: numerous open tabs, several random blogs, and an overload of information that is near-impossible to retain. It also requires the foresight to plan ahead of time in order to ensure your ideal trip—nearly half of all camping trips are planned within one week of departure. This can be burdensome to arrange, with no freedom to spontaneously embark on adventures. Additionally, when planning a last-minute trip, the extra thirty minutes spent searching for guidebooks or route details in the morning can cost you that perfect sunset or extra time spent with your family… or even cause you to contribute to park overcrowding.

As newer generations of adventurers seek different experiences and the options for outdoor recreation become more diverse, a dependable tech-driven infrastructure could alleviate many of these concerns, and ensure the safety of both recreationists and the environment. Information and resources on how to recreate responsibly, safely, and ethically are definitely prevalent across the internet. However, it is the lack of consolidated, equitable, standardized access to accurate and relevant information about outdoor recreational activities that plays a consequential role in the environmental harm that we see today.

To the detriment of all those who enjoy it, this outdated infrastructure is causing obvious consequences to our natural resources—the overcrowding of National Parks is only one piece of evidence of ongoing environmental degradation. By building and maintaining a collective repository of resources created by a community of well-informed, experienced, and reliable outdoor recreationists, Pathloom, the first all-in-one app for outdoor trip planning, can help diminish the gap of inequitable access and education in the outdoor community. We are fortunate enough to have the resources, knowledge, communal support, and technology to be able to assist adventurers in making their trip-planning experience more convenient, and beneficial to the environment as well. With less time spent planning your trip, more time becomes available to recreate responsibly, and perhaps make an individual difference for our natural treasures.

This issue must not be overlooked as the nation increasingly discusses the end of the pandemic. While this paradigm shift in how people are vacationing may have helped boost the popularity of outdoor recreational activities, the core problem of inequitable, inaccessible information in an industry that prides itself on inclusivity does not go away. While this problem may appear colossal and impossible to approach, individual efforts can help make a tangible difference in our outdoor community.

Tahoe Rim Trail - Prep Guide and Gear List
Proper Preparations for a 10 Day Solo Thruhike 

Tahoe Rim Trail, CA - Photo Credit: Ankit Jain
 
What is the Tahoe Rim Trail?

The Tahoe Rim Trail (TRT) is a 170-mile trail that circumnavigates California’s Lake Tahoe. It is shared by hikers, backpackers, bikers, and equestrians, passes through several Wilderness and State Park areas, and crosses the California-Nevada border twice. The elevation of the trail varies from ~6200 ft in Tahoe City, up to the 10,338 ft summit of Relay Peak. 

On my route I will spend 10 days on the trail heading counterclockwise, beginning at the Kingsbury North trailhead. I will spend the first half of the trip climbing up and over Relay Peak, will resupply in Tahoe City at my halfway point, then finish out the second half of the trail through the Desolation Wilderness and Big Meadow sections. 

The Desolation Wilderness section is the only part of the TRT that requires a permit, and luckily enough the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit issues permits specifically to thruhikers that bypasses the normal DW permit process, since it’s such a popular place to backpack in. I am also lucky to have two friends joining me for a few days of the trail, and my parents are meeting me at the end of the hike to celebrate as well!

Why did I choose the TRT to thruhike?

My ultimate goal is to hike the 2650-mile Pacific Crest Trail in a few years, so to prepare for that trip and get a taste of long-distance backpacking I thought that this trail would be a great introduction to thruhiking! Many people consider the TRT to be a good first thruhike because there are many access and exit points, several resupply options, a decent amount of trail traffic (so you’re not alone too often), and a relatively moderate trail grade and altitude level. 

While this trail of course requires a lot of planning and physical training (finding all the information and data to plan this trip took many weeks and lots of website-hopping! [Ed.: if only there was a company working tirelessly to develop an app that solves this problem!]), these resources allow hikers to attempt the trail at whatever speed or daily mileage they feel comfortable with. 

Additionally, the weather in the Tahoe area is typically ideal for hiking in the summer months - sunny but not too hot at 6,000’-10,000’ elevation, and minimal chance of inclement weather. This trail will certainly be a challenging, new experience for me, but I am excited to tackle it!

What trail conditions impacted my gear list?

I know I previously said that the summer weather in Tahoe is ideal for hiking, but unfortunately this year has been the exception! The lower-than-average snowfall this year means that the lake basin around Tahoe has been much drier than usual. Seasonal streams are drying up a month ahead of schedule, afternoon thunderstorms have been more common, and temperatures are higher even at greater altitudes. 

In addition, there is a much greater risk of wildfires earlier in the summer this year and although I don’t normally build backcountry campfires anyways, California has already issued an official campfire ban in many regions including the Tahoe area. All of these conditions have certainly impacted my gear list, since I first started planning in the winter! 

To address the dry conditions, I have two spots where I will be leaving water caches before starting my hike, and I will be carrying 5L of water capacity so I can safely make it through long dry stretches. I will also be ditching a warmth layer, but adding in rain pants and jacket to deal with potential thunderstorms, which can also help to protect against bugs. Finally, I will be switching out my usual sun visor for a bucket hat to shield my head and neck from the sun and heat. Check out my comprehensive gear list below!

Gear:

 Pack and Sleep Items 

1-person tent
60L backpack
Inflatable sleeping pad

I recently switched from my synthetic sleeping bag to a down quilt for the weight savings and flexibility. Quilts have an open back (you lay right on your sleeping pad), because down doesn’t help with insulation anyways when it is compressed underneath your back. I am also a very mobile sleeper and enjoy not feeling as constricted as when I’m in a mummy bag!

Backpacking Stove
650mL cook pot
Spork
Lighter
White gas fuel canister
Water filter
2L water bladder
2x 1L water bladders

A Fully Foiled Campfire Meal
3 Courses Worth of Recipes Using Nothing But Foil and a Fire

Your Quintessential Heat Source For These Recipes - Photo Credit: Bryan Donoghue 
 
When embarking on a camping trip, planning out your meals can often take a back seat to planning the activities you want to participate in while out in nature. Sometimes when it comes to what you’ll eat, it’s tough to figure out things that are both easy to cook over a fire and easy to travel with - especially when backpacking or thru-hiking! It can be overwhelming to think about in terms of cookware and easy refrigeration while still keeping a tasty menu. 
 Imagine how impressed your campground will be when they see you with a low-maintenance 3 course dinner starting with roasted asparagus, followed by potatoes and veggies and finished off with a personal pineapple upside down cake? The best part about it all? The only cookware you'll need for these is a roll of aluminum foil - and your heat source is the classic campfire you already have up and running! Accessories like a grilling rack certainly make things more convenient, but can be left at home if you need to keep your pack weight to a minimum. 


Roasted Asparagus
 This is an easy recipe to prepare either at your campsite itself, or at home in advance of your trip. If you’re prepping ahead of time, store the foil packet in a ziplock bag, as oil may leak from the packet. Store it in your cooler or refrigerated bag. By prepping everything ahead of time, all you’ll have to do is wrap up your asparagus in some tin foil and begin roasting! However, if you'd prefer to prep at your site, you can easily do so provided you've got a knife, a good surface to cut everything up on, and a roll of foil in your pack! Just make sure to clean your knife off immediately afterwards, as the juices from the veggies can cause stickiness and/or rust the blade.


Ingredients: 
Asparagus
Olive Oil
Salt/Pepper/Seasonings of choice
Lemon Slices (optional)
 Instructions: 
Wash your asparagus, then cut off about an inch from the bottom to avoid the stem, which can be tough and unpleasant on the palate. 
Spread the asparagus out on a long piece of foil, drizzle with olive oil, and season generously with salt, pepper, and any other seasonings you may have in your kit (for example, I never leave home without garlic powder). If you want lemon, add the lemon slices now. Roll the foil up so the asparagus is sealed in as best as possible.
You’ll need enough tin foil to lay down all stems of asparagus in a single layer with a few inches on either side. From there, pinch the edges together to make a small pouch. Don’t get too intricate here, it needs to be easily accessible to unpack so you can check on the tenderness so you can decide when to remove this from the fire. The longer it is cooking over the fire, the softer the asparagus will get. It depends on how hot your fire is and your personal preference for how long you choose to cook it, but about 6-10 minutes should do the job.
For those of us who like things a little crispier - after the asparagus has steamed through, unseal your packet, drain it off, and place the foil on a rock near the flames with the asparagus points facing inward. Let them get a little bit blackened by the fire for excellent texture prior to removing and serving!
 
Potatoes and Veggies

This is another recipe that can be prepared in advance with a cutting board, knife, and mixing bowl readily available in your kitchen, or made on-site with your knife, tin foil, and whatever you may have available to you at your campsite. This particular recipe is 100% vegan - but if you’d like, it’s very easy to grill up some sausages over the fire, cut them up, and include them in your foil packet with the other ingredients as well.
 

Ingredients: 
Yukon Gold/Yellow Potatoes
Whole Carrots
Onion
Olive Oil
Seasonings of choice
Sausage/Protein (optional)
 Instructions: 
For your potatoes, you’ll want to start off by making sure they’re clean - same goes for the carrots and onions as well. Once you begin to prep, your meal, thinly slice your potatoes - the thinner they are, the faster they’ll cook. You’ll also want to slice your onions into fairly thin slices too - no one wants giant onion chunks! For the carrots, you’ll want them to be cut into small coins. By having these ingredients sliced thin, it will make the cooking process much easier, and will make it easier to ensure everything is cooked evenly.  
Once everything is cut, you’ll want to add it all to a large mixing bowl (or tossed within your foil packet!) and coat it evenly with olive oil. Once everything is evenly coated, you can add any desired seasonings. 
For cooking, you’ll need a good amount of tin foil- about 2 feet per meal made. When you lay down the foil, you’ll want to lay out a thin layer of potatoes and vegetables. Begin to fold the corners of the tin foil flat and towards the center. When folding this meal pack, you’ll want it to be as seamless as possible so that when cooking, leaks will be minimal - it helps to roll the ends. 
Cook for about 20 minutes on each side, but cook time may vary depending on the sizes of your sliced food - not to mention the fire itself! 
 
Personal Pineapple Upside-Down Cake

You always have to save the best for last, right? This pineapple upside down cake will be a sweet and simple way to finish off your meal. The shortcake shells may take some searching at the stores before your trip, but the final product is most certainly worth it! Also noteworthy for the ingredients - the measurements listed below are for one personal cake, meaning if you’d like to make more than one at a time, you’ll need to multiply these measurements by however many you’d like to make. In general, fruit roasted over a fire brings out some unique and incredible flavors, and adding some shortcake to this mix ties everything together perfectly. 


 Ingredients: 
1 Maraschino Cherry 
1 Pineapple Slice
1.5 Tablespoons of Brown Sugar
1 Tablespoon of Unsalted Butter (or substitute)
1 Shortcake Shell
 Instructions: 
First, you’ll start with laying down your tin foil. Next, you’ll want to evenly sprinkle the brown sugar on the foil, followed by the tablespoon of butter or butter substitute. 
Set down the pineapple ring, and put the maraschino cherry in the hollowed part of the pineapple. 
Take your shortcake shell and place that so the flat side is facing up. 
Once all ingredients have been included, wrap the tin foil around the dessert and ensure the pack is sealed. Heat this over the fire for about 10-15 minutes, then allow a small amount of time to cool before touching the tin foil. Once you unwrap the cake from the foil, flip the cake so the fruit faces up and enjoy!

We’re a long way from craggy New England shorelines, illuminated by rustic lighthouses guiding Atlantic mariners to safe ports for centuries. We’re a long way from the snowy peaks of New Hampshire, home to some of the highest wind speeds and most unpredictable weather on the planet. We’re a long way from the lush wilds of Maine, thousands of acres of forest interrupted only by the occasional lake and maybe a cabin or two. 

We’re a long way from the idyllic suburbs of Connecticut, where “a good place to raise a family” gives way to children lashing out with petty crime to alleviate the never-ending march of sameness and crushing boredom. We’re a long way from the dark, gritty rock clubs of Boston, the gang vocals of the crowd screaming along in unity with arms around shoulders and fists raised in the air. We’re a long way from post-last-call at a seedy bar in Brooklyn, regret rushing in as the door opens to the stark gray flood of predawn, illuminating the streets and shedding light on the poor decisions made the night before. 

Hell, we’re a long way from everything. We’re in the middle of the %$@#$ desert. So vast, so foreign, so alien. The polar ecological opposite of anything I ever experienced while growing up in the Northeast. And I am utterly enraptured by the newness and novelty of it all.

No one told me about the haze that settles across the broad reaches of the desert, clearly visible yet somehow still not obstructing the view of the horizon, hundreds of miles away. 

Not enough people told me how goddamn cold it gets at night. Of course I had heard the stories, but I’m from the frigid, blizzard-ravaged, ice-encrusted hills of New England - how bad could it be? But just like a dry heat is still really f’ing hot; a dry cold is really f’ing cold - it shouldn’t be as bad as back East but it absolutely chills you straight to the bone. 

Everyone told me about the sunsets, but I didn’t truly believe them until I first arrived in Arizona, to witness furious fire and brimstone splashing across the evening sky, cotton candy cumulus painted across the horizon; staying illuminated for what seems like hours on end every night.

Over the past year alone I’ve been to three of the four Great Deserts of the United States, with only the Great Basin of northern Nevada evading my grasp. Shortly after I first entered the Sonoran Desert I shouted with delight as I saw my first Saguaro cactus - by the time I got to Phoenix I had seen literally millions, and that number increased to inconceivable proportions as I picked my way down towards Tucson. I’ve paid my respects to the squat Joshua Trees of the Mojave, witnessed them parched by the blistering sun in the low reaches and blanketed by snow at the desert’s higher elevations all within the span of a single day. I’ve blasted my way across the Chihuahuan Desert in West Texas - driving across the entire expanse in a single day one way, stopping to camp in the wind-fried scrublands the other. 

Each desert could not possibly be more different than the others, yet there is one commonality throughout them all that I can’t seem to get out of my head - none of them look anything like the clear vision of ‘desert’ I had in my head growing up. There have been no endless stretches of sun-washed golden sands rolling into gentle Saharan dunes. I have yet to witness a mirage (at least as far as I’m aware). I have not encountered a single Djinn or Ifrit, not even so much as a Whirling Dervish. There have been no prototypical oases, no palm-ringed crystalline pools (minus the blatantly fake man-made ones scattered around the Palm Springs area). We were promised camels, dammit.

Sure, these preconceived notions were foolishly formed by preadolescent visions of Tattooine, cartoons, mythology, and video games; but with the nearest desert over 2,000 miles away from my hometown such images were all I had to work with. I certainly intend to find my way to the glorious African and Asian deserts of my mind’s eye at some point in my life, but now I realize I still have so much exploring to do in the breathtakingly beautiful deserts of my home country. While this domestic exploration started out as a Covid-forced alternative to prohibited international travel, it now seems to be a wonderful way to wait out the exorbitant airfare prices and nightmarish airport experiences that abound as the world begins to wander again. 

So back into the Mojave I go this weekend, armed with the floppiest of wide-brimmed hats, the darkest of sunglasses, twin holsters housing twin water bottles dangling from my hips, and bandoliers of sunscreen bottles draped across my chest. There is so much more of these deserts to see, to explore, to experience - and I want to bear witness to all of it. I may have to cover up every last inch of my skin to ensure proper sun protection (should be fun in 120+ degree heat) - but it’s worth every bit of discomfort to be able to appreciate this biome, which could not possibly be any more different than the mossy humid forests of my youth.

"The Presidential Budget for fiscal year 2022 was submitted to Congress in late May, and includes a $3.5 billion investment in the country’s National Parks in anticipation of one of the busiest years in the history of the Service as a result of the pandemic. This represents a $700 million increase over last year’s budget, a good indication of the importance assigned by the new administration toward the preservation of the country’s natural beauty and resources."

Overcrowding, Flash Floods, Climate Change, Highlining &amp; More!

National Parks Overcrowding as Summer Arrives

The start of Summertime traditionally marks the seasonal flock of outdoor enthusiasts to National Parks and with reduced COVID-19 restrictions, National Parks are experiencing far more visitors than usual. After a decline in park visitations in 2019 and 2020, many of the most popular parks are experiencing a surge in attendance, especially in Yellowstone and the Great Smoky Mountains. 

While many National Parks have implemented reservation systems, this initiative may have backfired as long lines and wait times frustrate newcomers and seasoned guests alike. Many lodgings and campgrounds have already been booked for the entire Summer, and continued efforts on the part of some parks to maintain physical distancing regulations has made these attractions even more exclusive than usual. This has created additional problems, as an influx of less experienced visitors has led to more trash being left behind and many hikers concerning park rangers by straying off of marked trails. Larger crowds also make it difficult for Parks to recover from climate change-related wildfires.

 As an alternative, consider visiting lesser known places, including state parks and smaller city parks. As National Parks seem to always come to mind when planning outdoor trips, these smaller parks often get neglected - but still offer breathtaking sights. Still set on visiting National Parks? Research peak visitation hours and try to work around them. It might benefit you to wake up earlier and get there right as the park opens, so you can have a little privacy before the afternoon surge.

Flash Floods Cause Chaos at Zion National Park

Utah's flash flood season began with a vengeance on Tuesday, June 29th, as powerful thunderstorms caused flash flooding to wreak havoc throughout the park and surroundings. Though no casualties have been reported in this recent episode, floodwaters rushing through the narrow slot canyons have proven to be deadly in the past.

Several area businesses were devastated by the flood, including the recently renovated Zion Campfire Lodge located just outside the park, which will need to be torn down in entirety and rebuilt to resume business operations.

Though the park’s roads and trails have since re-opened, officials urge visitors to exercise extreme caution, and to expect delays and interruptions of services - especially considering additional storms are expected to wash through the area over the next few days. The flooding appears to have impacted nearby Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument as well, as two hikers needed to be airlifted to safety via helicopter.

New Report Shows Climate Change Effects on Yellowstone National Park

A report from Montana State University, the US Geological Survey, and the University of Wyoming shows the effects of increasing global temperatures on Yellowstone National Park and surroundings. This report, published June 23, finds that temperatures in America’s oldest National Park are the highest in at least the last 20,000 years, and could be the highest in the past 800,000. Yellowstone temperatures have been increasing steadily over the past seventy years, by 2.3°F on average. Scientists say it most likely will not stop there, predicting an increase of 5-10°F in follow-up years. 

What does this mean for the beloved park? First, Spring thaws will start several weeks earlier than usual and stream runoff will begin earlier as well, causing an influx of water in the region. The report also predicts a decline of snowfall with an increase of rainfall. Without reliable yearly snowfall, vegetation stays dry for much longer than normal, creating a mass of fuel for wildfires to ignite. This creates extreme safety hazards for visitors, and causes significant damage to the acreage of forests in the area. When exposed to excessive wildfires, many forests will most likely have a hard time replenishing themselves, meaning you may see grassland replace forests in many areas sooner than one would think. 

Increased droughts may also lead to the famous Old Faithful Geyser, which has faithfully erupted every 74 minutes or so without exception for years upon years, to cease eruptions altogether!

Glacier National Park's Going to the Sun Road is Open!

Montana's Glacier National Park is home to the famous Going to the Sun Road, a stretch of highway etched into the Rocky Mountains that allows you to see waterfalls, glaciers, and the stunning mountain ranges from a maximum height of 6,646 feet! This seasonal attraction is a great way to kick off the Summer, and enables you to see the park in its entirety without leaving your car. You will need a ticket to get onto the road, so make sure you get your passes here! Alternatively, you can  take a shuttle with other guests if that’s more your speed. The road is only open for the Summer (until around mid-October), so don’t miss out!

Wyoming Whiskey Raises $120k for National Park Foundation

Creative Director of Wyoming Whiskey, Harrison Ford, released a limited edition collection of artisanal whiskey inspired by the beauty of Wyoming National Parks, entitled Wide Open Spaces | By Air. The collection includes four exclusive bottles that are all named after locations within  Yellowstone and Grand Teton, including Black Sand Basin and Hayden Valley. Each one-of-a-kind bottle features aerial photos from the parks captured by photographer Tuck Fauntleroy, and comes with a hand-carved wooden case created by artist Jamison Sellers. 

In partnership with the National Park Foundation, each bottle was auctioned off in a virtual auction, with one bottle inspired by Yellowstone Lake selling for $15,000. To accompany the auction, Wyoming Whiskey also launched the Wide Open Spaces virtual exhibit to showcase the inspiration behind the collection as well as the team’s commitment to preserving the National Parks in the state. The brand also launched a new National Parks Limited Edition Bourbon Whiskey, with intention to give $5 of each bottle sold to the National Park Foundation.

Annual Wildflower Festival Held in Cedar Breaks, Utah - 7/2-7/11

This year’s Cedar Breaks Wildflower Festival will be hosted from July 2-11 in Cedar City, Utah. This festival highlights the wildflowers that bloom in Cedar Breaks National Monument and along the rim of the Cedar Breaks Amphitheater. Utah wildflowers are a real treat to the eyes, as 260 species of wildflowers bloom in the Summer months - painting the park in vibrant color. The park offers Wildflower walks four times per day at 9:30am, 11am, 1pm, and 2:30pm. These mile-long walks along the Sunset Trail meet in the Picnic Area and last about 45 minutes. 

In addition to this, the National Park Service has partnered with the Southern Utah Museum of Art to invite local artists into the park on the last day of the festival on Sunday, July 11th. These artists will stand at the park’s overlooks and create paintings inspired by the wildflowers and scenery around the park. Guests are encouraged to speak with these artists about their works to get a sense of their artistic process.

Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument to Host Night Sky Program - July 9

Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument in Teller County, Colorado will be hosting a series of programs in conjunction with the Colorado Springs Astronomical Society to gaze at stars, planets, and constellations with presentations and guided viewing. Participants will be able to view the night sky in all its majesty, as the National Monument is an hour away from any sort of light pollution that would hinder the experience. From the mountains, visitors will be able to see the Milky Way, star clusters, nebulae, comets, and so much more! 

Each program will begin at the visitors center, and the event is free with the $10 entry fee into the National Monument. Entry is free for children under 15, and the park offers a free Junior Ranger Program to encourage youth participation. This park is something of a hidden gem compared to the more popular counterparts in the state, so it tends to be far less crowded. Conveniently located about an hour outside Colorado Springs, this park is an easily accessible place to escape from the city and explore 15 miles of hiking trails.

Two Brothers Set Record for Longest Highline Ever Walked in California

Moises and Daniel Monterrubio set records last week by crossing a 2,800-foot gap on a high wire in Yosemite National Park. The brothers, along with a few of their friends, spent a week stringing the line from Taft Point across several ravines that plunge 1,600 feet down, to make sure the void was crossable and that their anchor points at either side were secure. After the week’s setup and with explicit permission from park rangers, the brothers and 18 of their friends took turns crossing the highline, several falling in the process. Highline walkers are protected by waist harnesses so these falls weren’t catastrophic, but the goal for most walkers is obviously to cross the entire line without falling. 

The group took turns walking the line for four days straight, trying to perfect their delicate balance and likely facing some intense fears. Daniel was the first to make it all the way across, though he fell and regained his composure a few times in the process. However, it was Moises who was able to complete the line without falling in just 37 minutes - as did his mentor, Eugen Cepoi. 

The previous record for longest highline walked in Yosemite was 954 feet, also extending from Taft Point. This walk was almost three times that length - over a half mile in distance while suspended a quarter mile above the ground!

National parks have historically been places that inspire morbid curiosity and rampant imagination. With acres of dense, often unexplored forest, many fear what could be lurking inside. These fears are not entirely irrational either, with 2,727 deaths in U.S. national parks over the past twelve years. Recently, many people have taken to TikTok to attempt to explain this phenomenon. Some claim those responsible for these deaths are hordes of feral cannibal people, living in the depths of National Parks, killing and eating people. This theory has been trending on the video platform TikTok, where outdoor enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists alike have been sharing their own stories of national park visits, ranging from mildly creepy to downright terrifying. 

TikToker @chroniclesofolivia posted a video detailing her experience at Lena Lake in Washington State, in which she found hundreds of what she described as “humanoid footsteps”, at the top of the mountain she was climbing. After filing an official report with no conclusive evidence, Olivia still contends that the footsteps she found belonged to humanoid creatures that the government is hiding due to their lack of official species classification. Mysteriously, her TikToks describing her experience have been deleted (though her videos are still available on her YouTube channel)...

In January of this year, another TikToker going by the name of @thepresentbeliever claimed to hear blood curdling screams during her visit to Big Bend National Park in Brewster County, Texas. While camping with her husband and daughter, Ariele heard multiple people screaming deep within the wilderness of the park, yelling phrases such as “we’re gonna die!”, “call a ranger,” and “I love you, just know that.” Ariele and her family reported the incident to the police and park rangers, who found nothing. There has been no documented evidence of this incident, but her story has made the rounds on TikTok and has inspired many others to tell their stories as well.

After TikToks like these went viral, hundreds of other videos have surfaced of people telling similar stories of creepy happenings in National Parks and near National Park lands, and with the help of conspiracy theorists and groupthink, many have jumped to the same conclusion: the existence of feral, cannibal people. These theorists assert that due to the dense and largely undiscovered nature of National Parks, that a subhuman species of people have been living in these areas and occasionally terrorizing locals and visitors alike - refusing entirely to take into account the existence of dangerous wildlife in these disappearances. TikToker @garcious even claims that there are several eyewitness accounts of these creatures, and that police are neglecting to investigate. As rumors run amok, an increasing number of people have stated that they will never enter a National Park again, for fear of these creatures. 
  Sustainability scientist and content creator, Alaina Wood (known as @thegarbagequeen on TikTok) also contributed to this conversation through her TikTok, doing her best to debunk some of these rumors with a far more plausible explanation - you can view her video below:


In her TikTok, Alaina reacts to a video of another TikToker filming herself while camping in the Great Smoky Mountains, where creepy noises can be heard in the background. Alaina, as a resident of the Tennessee Mountains, explains her familiarity with wildlife noises such as the ones coming from coyotes heard in the video. She goes on to debunk the cannibalistic people theory, and explains that many of these “spooky” happenings in National Parks can be chalked up to animals like bears, bobcats, cougars, and other wildlife.

Other natives of the Appalachian Mountains area have also come forward to speak out about this, claiming that much of these stories come from folklore and myth that have been around for years. Many note that conspiracy theories like these uphold harmful stereotypes about Appalachian people, and circulate unnecessary fear-mongering about the often misunderstood population. It is likely, those native to the area note, that much of the hysteria around killer cannibals comes from long retold pieces of folklore that are just now reaching the mainstream.

However, instances of missing people in National Parks are still all too real, and a string of cold cases leaves unanswered questions about those who were never found. Former police officer and investigator David Paulides released several books and one documentary on this subject, titled Missing 411. This series chronicles many disappearances that Paulides investigated throughout his career, all of which took place in National Parks, and none offering any plausible explanation.

One of the most famous cases from his series is that of Dennis Martin, a 6-year-old boy who in 1969 hid behind a tree during a game of hide and seek with his famIly in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. As if into thin air, Martin disappeared and could not be found through the aid of his father and accompanying family. Later, the police and national park service began a full investigation of him but he was still never found.

Dennis’ story is a parental nightmare. Little evidence was found to support any plausible explanation for the boy’s disappearance - save for a set of children’s footprints leading to a stream, believed by some police officers to be Dennis’. However, the footprints were dismissed as evidence as there were investigators in the area when they were found... although no children were with them at the time. Because of this, many consider Dennis’ investigation to be a failure and even though this could be a reasonable explanation for how he disappeared, by falling into the lake, there are no concrete answers.

Besides the footprints, only one piece of anecdotal evidence was found but was again, largely dismissed by police. One hour after the time of Dennis Martin going missing, a neighboring family claimed to see a bear in the same area. However, the creature's furry appearance was the only thing likening it to a bear, as the family described the creature ducking and weaving around trees and running like a human, while seeming to carry a child over his shoulder. Again, this testimony was never brought into evidence by the police, and the connections between the two incidents were only made later by Paulides while researching for Missing 411. To this day, no concrete conclusions have been given for this case, and the rest of the Martin family remains bewildered.

Another case that raises eyebrows is that of 2-year-old Keith Parkins, who disappeared while visiting his grandfather’s ranch in the middle of Ritter, Oregon by Umatilla National Forest. His disappearance launched a full investigation by local authorities, which led to him being found twelve miles away from the ranch and lying unconscious in the snow! As a toddler, Keith had no way of moving this far on his own and without warm clothing, it’s surprising that he even survived. Years later as an adult, Parkins was interviewed for Missing 411, and claims to have no recollection of the event. The case leaves many questions that remains unanswered, and many are still fascinated by it. No one has figured out how a young child could have moved such a far distance in the middle of the night through such adversity, and some wonder if a person or creature was responsible for moving him. Like these, there are many other cases that have been documented similarly in National Parks. For more information, check out Missing 411 either on Hulu or as the book series.

Phenomena like these are undoubtedly interesting, bewildering, and indeed somewhat creepy. However, many of these stories have plausible explanations, even if you have to do some digging to find them. Some swear that these instances are all a part of a large government coverup of something heinous going on in these parks, while others blame disappearances simply on bears. Do you think there is a connection between these events? That things may not be as they appear, or that the wilderness is full of naturally dangerous elements? Whatever you think, do your research and look into these occurrences a little closer - they may not be as scary as they may first appear. Why not go see for yourself what they’re all about?

Over the course of many trips into the outdoors, I’ve learned the importance of staying fueled with proper nutrition when out on the trails. However, normal store-bought energy bars and trail mix can become boring and unappetizing after a few hikes. With that in mind, here are some recipes that can be easily prepped in advance of a hike, that offer delicious alternatives to the same old snacks.

 

Energy Balls

Ever since I was younger, I would go through phases where I would love a specific food and eat it endlessly for a given amount of time. Then there would be a random day where I decided I’m over that food, and would no longer have any desire to eat it. With these energy balls, I am able to customize them according to my current flavor-of-the-month and keep things fun. The easy preparation of these are another thing that makes this one of my favorite trail recipes. All you have to do is combine your ingredients in a bowl, ball them up, and then lay them out to solidify in the fridge for a small amount of time before packing them into a bag for the trail.
 You may be wondering why I call these energy balls. James Fisher, Certified Personal Trainer and Performance Enhancement Specialist has mentioned that carbohydrates are your body’s main energy source when hiking or backpacking. The name can be whatever your heart desires, but the carbohydrates and protein from these ingredients should be enough to keep you going for miles on end.

Nut Butter (Peanut, Almond, Cashew, etc) 
Honey/Agave
Quick Oats
Any other small add-ins
 Instructions: 

As mentioned above, this recipe is very easy to tailor to your likes, so there aren’t any exact instructions. I usually will start off with a spoonful of Peanut Butter, then add about ½ cup of oats. From here I begin to combine those two together since I like to have a firmer ball. By eyeballing the ratio here I will add about a tablespoon of honey and slowly add more oats as well while still combining my ingredients. I find it helpful to slowly add things as needed so that I can make enough to satisfy any upcoming snack needs. 

Once I reach a consistency that I enjoy, I’ll add in small treats I find tasty. Some great examples I’ve used are mini chocolate chips, chia seeds, mini-M&amp;Ms, or even coconut shreds. Roll the dough into small balls in the palm of your hand. Again, this is customizable if you prefer smaller or larger portions. Once all the dough has been rolled into balls, lay them out onto a plate or sheet pan. Place this into the fridge for at least 20 minutes and then pack it up into a small Tupperware or reusable bag for easy access!
 Some Pro Tips: 
The amount of oats used will vary based on the nut butter that is used. If the nut butter you’re using is high in oil, there will need to be more oats to absorb the oil so the balls can be properly formed. If you run into your dough being too oily to hold a shape, try laying it out in a thin layer and refrigerate. Once it has cooled and solidified, try cutting it into small squares. 
If you find a great ratio that uses honey with a measuring cup, spray the measuring cup with pan oil before measuring your honey. Trust me, this makes cleanup a lot easier, and also helps to reduce wasted honey that sticks to the measuring cup. 
Try a quick Google or Pinterest search for “energy balls” or “protein balls” for some add-in inspiration - the possibilities are endless!

 

Dried Fruit 

This one is quite self-explanatory. I love fruit as a low-cost option to obtain vital natural sugars. I find dried fruit to be a great go-to during the winter when I’m avoiding turning on the heat in my house - by using the oven low-and-slow for hours to dehydrate, it solves my needs for both food and warmth! The dehydration process can also be performed using an air fryer if you have the proper equipment. Martha Stewart has a great at-home recipe to dehydrate fruit quickly and easily.
 Ingredients: 
Fruit of choice
Sugar (Optional)
 Instructions: 
Preheat oven to 225 degrees 
Lay down parchment paper on a baking sheet
Arrange thinly cut fruit on baking sheet, a few inches apart
(Optional) Sprinkle sugar on top of fruit if desired to make it sweeter 
Place pan in the oven and allow the fruit to begin dehydration
Allow fruit to dehydrate from 1.5-4 hours based on fruit used (check occasionally)
Once the fruit has reached your preferred level of dehydration, remove it from the oven and leave to cool
 Some Pro Tips: 
Only add sugar to fruits that are typically very tart or sour-tasting. This will offset the tartness and make it a bit more pleasant once dried. 
You’ll be able to tell your fruit is almost done dehydrating if the edges are dry and shriveled, but the centers still look tender and juicy.
If your fruit leaks liquid during the dehydration process, baste the fruit with the liquid hourly. Leakage will depend on the water content that is in your fruit of preference, but this will help keep the fruit’s flavor and tenderness intact.
Experiment with it! This is a fun food science situation where you can see how your favorite fruits taste dehydrated. I once saw dried chile pineapple at Trader Joe’s and tried making it myself by sprinkling some spicy seasoning on the pineapple after I pulled it from the oven - it was delightful!

 

DIY Trail mix

Have you ever bought a bag of trail mix from the store and found yourself searching through the bag for your favorite pieces? I know I used to hunt for all the M&amp;M’s or raisins because I never thought there was enough sweetness. A DIY Trail mix is something that you can tailor to your own preferences, and is a great way to get rid of small amounts of food in the pantry that you are otherwise unsure what to do with. 

With trail mix there obviously isn’t much of a recipe - just throw your favorite morsels together in a bag and toss it into your backpack before heading out! This is also a great way to manage dietary restrictions such as nut allergies - it can sometimes be tough to find a store-bought mix suited to your specific needs! 

While looking for some inspiration on combination ideas, I found a guide that transformed the way I created my mixes. While this section is very flexible with ingredients and instructions, I thought I’d share this chart from UPMC for you to reference should you decide to give this a chance!

Some Pro Tips:
Try to combine flavors - a good balance of salty and sweet will ensure your mix will be tasty enough that you’ll stay fueled during your trek!
Try chopping up some dehydrated fruit from the previous recipe and adding it to your mix!
You may want to avoid chocolate or other pieces that could melt if you’re planning on hiking in hot weather. If your sweet tooth won’t permit that, the hard candy shell of M&amp;M’s makes them much more resistant to meltage than chocolate chips.
Check your local grocery store to see if they have a bulk section. This is an extremely cost-effective way to gather ingredients for your mix!

Today, I can’t imagine my life without the beauty of the outdoors. In fact, I am absolutely passionate about hiking, camping, and backpacking. I often find myself daydreaming about future hiking adventures, and all of the incredible trails I have yet to explore. 

But that wasn’t always the case. Although I grew up in Northern California, surrounded by majestic redwood forests, I was (unfortunately) apathetic to the fact that I had access to some of the country’s best hiking trails right in my backyard. 

It was only until I was invited to a last minute trip to hike up Half Dome in Yosemite National Park when that all changed…

Let me set the scene here — I had just graduated from college, and was working my first job as an engineer in a fairly remote area in Central California. What I didn’t realize at the time was that I was just a few hours away from some of the most incredible alpine landscapes and trails: the Sierra Nevada. While that didn’t appeal to me at that time, I started meeting people who were “Weekend Warriors”: they’d pack up their car on Fridays at 4pm, drive out to Yosemite or Sequoia National Park or a remote Eastern Sierra campsite, hike and climb all weekend long and get back home by Sunday night. 

I started looking forward to Mondays, when I could hear more about their adventures in the wilderness. I soon found myself wanting to join these adventures. There was a sense of freedom, adventure, and lightheartedness that I wanted to experience. 

It was a beautiful coincidence that one of my friends had an extra spot on his Half Dome permit, texted me to see if I wanted to come, and within seconds I responded with a firm “I’M IN.”

That simple text set off what would be an incredible journey of exploration, and eventual obsession, with the outdoors. 

But let’s not sugarcoat what I was actually feeling at the time  — I was terrified. To be quite frank, I was fairly unfit at the time, and I had never signed myself up for a hike as grueling as Half Dome.

If you’re not familiar with the hike up to Half Dome, it’s quite the slog - 16 miles and 4,800 feet of elevation to get to the top. Oh, and you also have to ascend the last 400 feet on an incredibly steep and slippery granite rock face with nothing but two cables and rickety wooden planks to assist you.

While that would have been a cause for concern (and anxiety) a year earlier, now the prospect of a new adventure and even more enticing accomplishment was intoxicating. All I could envision was myself, triumphant on the summit of Half Dome, living up to my namesake: limitless.

It was mid-July when we arrived in Yosemite Valley for the night. As we hunted for our cabin in the darkness of night, my senses were overloaded: the air was entirely saturated with pine, and an infinite number of stars were piercing through the dark blanket of the night sky.
 The next day was nothing short of incredible. Half Dome was not even in sight when we began the first of 16 miles, but 6 long hours of hiking later, I found myself at the summit, overlooking waves and domes of granite. Sure, I was huffing and puffing throughout the hike, but I never once thought of quitting. During the entire hike, I simultaneously felt carefree and obsessive — I experienced the addictive taste of accomplishment, and I already wanted more.

This trip truly was the catalyst to kickstart my passion for challenging myself by exploring the outdoors. I attribute most of my personal growth over the years to my outdoor adventures. I used to shy away from new experiences that pushed me out of my comfort zone, but now I embrace the feeling of being uncomfortable. That Half Dome trip unlocked an endless source of fulfillment, joy and grit that has impacted my life in tremendously positive aspects. 

Now, on to the next adventure…

Taken From: Bury My Heart in Big Bend National Park 
(published 5/3/2021)

"Big Bend National Park is that place - nestled in the elbow of Texas. This park is as unique as it is mystical, an absolutely precious landscape with a soul unlike any other. Over three hundred miles from El Paso, and four hundred from San Antonio, this Lone Star Lovely is a remote desert paradise lined with scenic mesas and grand mountains."

Taken From: National Park News: May 2021
(published 5/6/2021)

"Acadia, Glacier, Rocky Mountain, Yosemite, and Zion National Parks have introduced reservations in an effort to reduce overcrowding and encourage social distancing. The cost of most of these reservations are trivial - meant more as a means of managing the number of visitors than as an additional revenue stream - but it should be noted that these costs are separate from the regular park entry fees."

(published 5/10/2021)

"Chase the wind as pressures fade in the rearview, wake up in the dew of a fresh season. Be a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis - break out of your routine and spread the wings of adventure; soar into the breeze that makes the aspens quake, and shake free the grime of a sedentary year."

(published 5/13/21)

"Frenchman Coulee is actually located closer to George, Washington than the town of Vantage, and on the other side of the Columbia River, but for some reason climbers call it “Vantage.” Whatever you call it, it’s a very pretty area of high desert columnar basalt, with sport climbs on the faces and trad climbs in the cracks in between."
 
Union Falls: Yellowstone National Park - Photo Credit: Andrew Helmbrecht

Taken From: 4 Epic Yellowstone Day Hikes to Beat the Crowds 
(published 5/27/21)

"The Park’s Grand Loop Road (the main park road connecting lodging outposts and key park landmarks) allows visitors to access less than 1% of Yellowstone’s splendor - yet still, over 90% of tourists never leave the main road. Some see this as a frustrating reality, but for those that know Yellowstone best, this actually presents an extremely exciting opportunity."

Pride at Pathloom


At Pathloom, we are dedicated to making the outdoors more accessible for everyone, and we are proud to highlight other individuals, groups, and organizations with similar missions. We recognize that many communities are underrepresented when it comes to the Great Outdoors, and we want to work to change that however we are able to. In honor of Pride Month, we’d like to use this space to showcase three recent outdoors-related LGBTQ+ news highlights before continuing with our usual monthly National Park-focused News coverage. Happy Pride everyone! 
Cyclist, avid outdoorsman, and National Parks expert Mikah Meyer is organizing a 363-mile ride down the Oregon Coast to build awareness for Outdoor Safe Space and to do his part to make the Outdoors more inclusive for the LGBTQ+ community.
Texas-based organization LGBT+ Outdoors has announced the inaugural LGBT+ Outdoorfest will be held on September 24-26, 2021 at the Rainbow Ranch Campground near Groesbeck, Texas. This event will feature workshops providing introductions to a litany of outdoor activities such as hiking, kayaking, and nature photography 
On May 18th, filmmaker Devin Fei-Fan Tau released the film “Who’s On Top?”, depicting a group of LGBTQ+ athletes’ epic ascent of Oregon’s famed Mount Hood. The film, narrated by national treasure George Takei, draws parallels between the arduous journey up and down the mountainside and the struggle many in the community face with coming out and embracing their gender and sexuality, while also presenting real role models for outdoors-minded LGBTQ+ aspirants.

America’s Newest National Park Expects Influx in Tourism this Summer


Long a beloved vacation spot for local and regional tourists alike, the naming of New River Gorge in West Virginia as an official National Park showcases the area for tourists across the country and the world as a must-see destination. From the abundant Springtime blooms to the spectacular foliage in the Fall, New River Gorge’s unusual climate allows for both breathtaking scenery and a wide range of potential activities to indulge in. 53 miles of rapids allow for ample whitewater rafting opportunities, while the steep sandstone walls of the gorge attract rock climbers of all skill levels. 100 miles of trails provide plenty of opportunity for hiking and mountain biking. 

Local officials are expecting at least a 20% increase in visitors now that the region has been redesignated from a National River to a National Park. Local business owners (and the state’s senators that sponsored this redesignation) hope this could bring immense benefits to the state’s economy. The park is actively recruiting volunteers to assist with this anticipated rush of traffic for their first summer as an official National Park.

Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park Re-Closes, 2 days after Season Opening


At a peak elevation of 12,183 feet, the highest paved road in the United States can often be subject to harsh weather conditions. Trail Ridge Road, the primary thoroughfare through Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado and one of the most scenic roads in the country, has closed down due to stormy weather conditions just two days after opening up for the first time in over 7 months. The road had been closed since October 2020 - a large-scale wildfire and subsequent snowstorm making for impassable conditions late last season. The road typically opens on Memorial Day weekend and indeed did so this year, only to be shut down again after a late season snowstorm hit the area early this week. Once the road reopens, a reservation will be required to traverse this beautiful scenic byway, though capacity has been expanded as compared to last year’s Covid-related restrictions.

Hot Springs National Park celebrates Centennial, Re-opens Fordyce Bathhouse


Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas is celebrating the 100th anniversary of their designation as a National Park with a series of events over the course of the summer. Click here for a list of events to plan travel around - don’t miss out on the “Running Of The Tubs!" In addition to this, thanks to an easing of Covid-related restrictions, the Park has reopened the historic Fordyce Bathhouse Museum &amp; Visitor Center for the first time since the  pandemic forced them to shut their doors in early 2020. Since bathing in the Park’s eponymous outdoor hot springs is prohibited (and dangerous, they’re hot!), this reopening expands visitors’ opportunities to experience all of the health benefits that soaking in (and drinking!) these waters has to offer.

Virtual Grand Canyon Star Party to be held June 5-12


This year’s Grand Canyon Star Party, the 31st annual edition of the event, will be held virtually via the Grand Canyon’s official Facebook page every evening from June 5-12. The event will feature a series of speakers from the traditionally associated tribes of the Grand Canyon, and will focus on cultural astronomy from the tribal perspective. Astronomers will have video cameras connected to telescopes that they can use to highlight various celestial objects to discuss their significance. As an International Dark Sky Park, the Grand Canyon is uniquely situated to provide some of the best views of the stars on the entire planet, and this event will help to provide some important historic, cultural, and scientific context for what can be seen in the night sky.

Federal Budget to allot $3.5 Billion to National Park Service


The Presidential Budget for fiscal year 2022 was submitted to Congress in late May, and includes a $3.5 billion investment in the country’s National Parks in anticipation of one of the busiest years in the history of the Service as a result of the pandemic. This represents a $700 million increase over last year’s budget, a good indication of the importance assigned by the new administration toward the preservation of the country’s natural beauty and resources. The budget includes support for a broad range of Park concerns, such as park infrastructure upgrades, preservation of tribal cultural heritage, climate vulnerability assessments, and even body cameras for park law enforcement officials.

30 Dark Songs for Dark Nights by the Campfire

Somewhere in the Mendocino Mountains, CA - Photo Credit: Bryan Donoghue 
 

Searching the flames for echoes of love long lost. Searching the coals for redemption for a litany of regrets. Searching the stars above for answers to questions you’ve never had the guts to ask. Searching the bottom of the bottle for those last few drops of whiskey to help you forget. Fire breeds introspection, long pauses filled with self-reflection, and quiet inner contemplation.

There’s much to be said for the sounds of silence at the campsite - nothing to interrupt your thoughts but the crackle of the fire, the night wind rustling through the trees, the occasional critter crunching through the underbrush. There is true beauty in the sounds of nature in the pitch black of night - a quiet symphony of sounds not found in any other setting. 

Late at night, very late, when all other campers have retreated to their tents and I’m sitting alone by the fire, just before putting it out for the night - whether it’s deep in the woods or on top of a mountain, on the shores of a lake or in the middle of a desert - there is nothing else in this world I would rather listen to.

But sometimes…

Sometimes I want more. Sometimes the situation just calls for some music (To be faiiiir - with me, most situations do.) But out in the outdoors - there are certain requirements for suitable songs. They can’t be too upbeat - that doesn’t really fit the mood. They can’t be too heavy - that’s a better fit for the city streets back home. Personally, I’m not much for happy songs, so those are out too. For me, for the campsite, for the fire - give me something dark, something twangy, something moving. A little bit of slide guitar, maybe some banjo or harmonica around the edges, throw in a few boots stomping if you're lucky. Country-ish but not country. Bluesy but not blues. Folksy but not folk. Something that dwells in that gray area somewhere in between. Dark gray.

With that, here are 30 of the deepest, darkest, and absolute best (in my entirely humble and unbiased opinion) songs for camping, in regular rotation at any campfire you’ll find me at throughout the world. For those of you with Spotify, there’s a link here and a player at the bottom to add these as a playlist to your own library. For our readers who prefer YouTube, we've put together a playlist over on the Pathloom YouTube channel of all the linked videos below. Play it on shuffle, there’s no method to this madness.

A special thanks to friends and family I’ve camped with and swapped songs with throughout the years - you’re all an important part of what makes the outdoors so beautiful to me (and sorry, most of you have probably heard most of these before...)

The Grand Canyon State holds much more than the seminal canyon carved by the indomitable Colorado River. From the Mexican border all the way up to Utah, the wealth of desert landscape is remarkable, and holds countless opportunities for adventure that pushes the limits of an explorer’s credulity. This article is just a taste of the fantastic beauty Arizona holds, from the land of cactus forests to the legendary world of red rock formations carved by the celestial paintbrush of time.

Arizona is a rich land of immense beauty that encompasses portions of all four American deserts, and hosts an awe-inspiring range of iconic landscapes supporting unique plants and animals. With the Mojave Desert in the west, the Sonoran Desert in the south, The Chihuahuan Desert to the east, and the Colorado Plateau in the north - Arizona is the quintessential Desert state.

The lowest point in Arizona is 72 feet above sea level (San Luis, AZ) in the lower Sonoran Desert - the highest point is Humphreys Peak at 12,637 feet in the north. This diversity in elevation lends itself to an ecological mixed bag, giving the state everything from lowland deserts to alpine tundras. Southwest Arizona from Phoenix to Yuma is the lowest part of the state - the elevation climbs to the north and east, building toward the Grand Staircase starting just south of Utah. My journey took me from the lush low desert up into the desolate high desert. Experiencing Arizona’s transitional zones from desert to desert is a glimpse into the dry biome that is so essential to Earth. The low desert is known for its bi-seasonal rains and scarce freezing periods, opposite to the high desert’s deep freezes and wet winters. These two contrasting biomes give Arizona its unique character of diverse landscapes.

Massive monsoons build in the Gulf of California and descend upon the Sonoran Desert, making it the wettest desert on the planet. There are two main rainy seasons: one occurring in early spring and the latter in the late summer months, both bordered on either side by hot and dry periods. This gives the Sonoran a unique array of animals and plants that aren’t found anywhere else on Earth. 

The official wildflower of Arizona is the blossom of the mighty Saguaro cactus, the most iconic of the state’s plants. Though it is only found in the Sonoran desert, this cactus is a symbol for deserts everywhere - and for good reason. The Saguaro live upwards of 150 years, taking on their unique shapes as they reach for the sun; hitting heights of up to 40 feet tall. These Sonoran señors line the highways of Arizona and make for a horizon that isn’t found anywhere else. It is breathtaking to speed down a Sonoran thoroughfare - especially during sunset.

Experiencing this absolute gem of a biome can be done via a variety of National Monuments and National Parks. My favorite protected desert world is the wondrous Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. This famed monument is on the border with Mexico just south of Ajo, AZ,  protecting a rich forest of the namesake cactus, Saguaro, and ocotillo that rest between picturesque desert mountains. The piglike Javalinas, legendary Desert Bighorns, notorious Mountain Lions, and renowned Coyotes govern this arid paradise that exists between the United States and Mexico. 

The borderlands add a special character to this National Monument - Border Patrol stations and sporadic Border Patrol vehicles on park roads bring an added sense of adventure to this picturesque landscape, divided by the barrier between nations. With the lights of the Mexican town Sonoyta flickering in the distance, and the sweet smell of Ocotillo and Opuntia blooms in the air, I was lucky enough to watch April’s pink full moon rise above the vast desert - a moment that will forever be in my heart.

To the north of the Sonoran Desert is another treasure trove of striking settings that seem to be from a world of fantasy; the famed Petrified Forest National Park in the Painted Desert is a wondrous landscape that is absolutely unforgettable. Sedona with its divine rock monoliths will stamp the imagination, and Lake Powell as it sits between regal canyons is begging to be explored. 

Baking in the sun just below the Utah border lives the most iconic of rock formations... 

Monument Valley - a breathtaking sight to see, deep in the heart of the Navajo Nation. Arizona is a treasure of landscape, plants, animals, and culture. No journey across America is complete without diving into this desert greatness. Epic sunsets, unforgettable landmarks, and a special charm that isn’t found anywhere else on earth - The desert calls for you to explore it.

"Since the swimming area sits in a small inlet in direct view of the lighthouse, you’ll get the benefit of warmer water temperatures (but still quite cold until Late July/Early August - that’s just New England) and a chance to take a swim while you gaze up at a classic New England landmark. Fun fact: the Portland Head Lighthouse is the oldest in Maine, and the most photographed in America!"

Acadia, Glacier, Other National Parks to Mandate Reservations for Day-Use Visitors


Several of the most popular National Parks in the country have expanded their reservation system to include day-use visitors, in addition to existing overnight/backcountry permitting already in effect. Acadia, Glacier, Rocky Mountain, Yosemite, and Zion National Parks have introduced reservations in an effort to reduce overcrowding and encourage social distancing. The cost of most of these reservations are trivial - meant more as a means of managing the number of visitors than as an additional revenue stream - but it should be noted that these costs are separate from the regular park entry fees. Specific policies vary by park, but most require these reservations to be made ahead of time - and due to the popularity of these parks (and their pandemic-related capacity restrictions), it is recommended to secure tickets well in advance.

Grand Canyon Announces Massive Infrastructure Overhaul


National Park Service representatives have announced plans to repair the 12.5 mile pipeline that has provided the majority of the Grand Canyon’s South Rim with its water supply for over 60 years. The repairs are set to begin in January 2023, and expected to last up to two years. Engineers plan on doing all they can to reduce the impact this will have on visitors, but some trail and facility closures are expected to occur at various times throughout the repair period. Among the most popular attractions expected to be closed are the River Trail and Phantom Ranch Campground. Aspiring Grand Canyon visitors may want to push up their plans to 2021 or 2022 to ensure they are not impacted by these imminent closures.

NPS to Roll Out Autonomous Vehicles in Yellowstone, Other National Parks Throughout 2021


The National Park Service is teaming up with local Departments of Transportation to introduce self-driving shuttles to parks across the country in 2021. Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Wright Brothers National Monument in North Carolina will be the first to introduce a pilot program to assess the feasibility of autonomous vehicles to transport visitors to popular attractions throughout the park. Though the shuttles will operate without human input (at speeds of 8-12 MPH), an operator will ride in each vehicle to ensure safety in event of malfunction. Ideally, this solution will lead to reduced congestion on the roadways and less overcrowding at popular areas - improving overall visitor experience. This is a fascinating window into how future technology may impact our country’s natural treasures, at a time when visitor management is more important than ever in parks to limit the potential spread of Covid-19.

Crystal Cave Reopens in Sequoia National Park


Crystal Cave, an extremely popular attraction within Sequoia National Park, has officially announced it will reopen beginning Memorial Day Weekend 2021, after closing down for the entire 2020 season due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Reservations, which must be made in advance of a visit, became available on Recreation.gov as of May 1 for dates ranging from Thursday-Sunday through the end of October. The extremely delicate formations within the cave are beautiful to see, but so fragile that a guide is required to enter the cave to ensure the contents of the cave remain undisturbed. The stalactites, stalagmites, and subterranean waterways are once again open to the public after shutting down last year for the first time since opening in 1940.

Mesa Verde Certified as 100th International Dark Sky Park


The International Dark Sky Organization has announced that Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado has been recognized as an official Dark Sky Place - indicating it is one of the best places on the entire planet for stargazing. These ideal conditions are found when aridity and elevation combine with distance from sources of light pollution - and Mesa Verde has all in abundance. This certification is both a tribute and a commitment to preserve the same night skies witnessed by the Pueblo Indians over their ancestral homeland for hundreds upon hundreds of years. The NPS recommends Morefield Campground, Far View Lodge, or any of the overlooks along the park road as ideal stargazing locations. This certification comes just in time for Milky Way Season, which runs through September in the Northern Hemisphere.

Whether you’re an avid sky watcher or or just head out to catch the occasional meteor shower, there is a good chance you heard about last year's especially vivid “Christmas Star”, Jupiter and Saturn’s Great Conjunction on December 21st. The event made national news as the two planets haven’t been this close since the year 1623. What few people know is that conjunctions are fairly common between other planets and astronomical objects. They may not all be worthy of the title of “Great”, but these events are quite interesting regardless. You’ll be able to see two or more of these stunning astronomical objects — most of which are not usually visible to the naked eye — and their orbits will be so close together that they’ll appear within the same lens of a telescope! Want to know more? Pathloom’s Official Guide to Planet Conjunctions is here for everything you need to know about these astronomical wonders!

Throughout January, we experienced seven conjunctions, including a rare triple conjunction of Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn on January 10th. We witnessed six more in February, with so many more to come throughout the rest of 2021. Scroll down to the bottom of this page (or click here) for a list of conjunctions occurring throughout the remainder of the 2021 Calendar Year.

What are Planetary Conjunctions?

Astronomical Conjunctions occur when two astronomical objects - such as planets, stars, moons, or the sun - align in the sky, creating an illusion that they are close together when in reality they are thousands of miles apart. The objects are bright, so you’ll be able to see them with the naked eye, but with binoculars or a telescope, you can view amazing details - such as the rings of Saturn, or the moons surrounding these planets!

How to View Planetary Conjunctions

Viewing a planetary conjunction is easy, but it does require a bit of planning. First, know when to arrive at your location. These events often occur all day but they’re typically most visible about 45 minutes after sunset. Be aware of the sun’s afterglow, however, which may wash out the view. If this happens, you may have to wait a little longer to see anything.

Also, be mindful of the placement of the objects in the sky. It’d be disappointing to go out of your way to see an astronomical wonder that is hidden behind trees from your viewpoint because it’s lower in the sky than you expected! The ideal viewing locations have a horizon that is as clear as possible, such as open fields and beaches. If these flat areas aren’t available to you, look for high vantage points like balconies, hills, or anywhere else that can provide an elevated view of the horizon. When you get there, apps such as Star Walk 2 are a great help to ensure that you’re looking in the right direction. This app maps out the entire sky so you can view the locations of planets, constellations, and moons in real time, directly through your phone. 

If you live in an urban area, you’re going to want to find somewhere with as little light pollution as possible. Luckily, you won’t have to go as far as you’d necessarily think. The suburbs just outside your city often work well enough, depending on the brightness of the planets. I was able to see the Great Conjunction last December just while driving around in my suburban town! Alternatively, if you’re feeling adventurous, use the conjunction as an excuse to go camping, or take a night hike into the wilderness for optimal viewing conditions.

The one factor you won’t be able to plan for, but arguably the most important, is the presence of a clear sky. Planets are seen best without overcast clouding your experience so try to avoid nights that will definitely be rainy or foggy. Planetary conjunctions also vary in brightness so they might not as easily visible at first - but don’t lose hope! Many of these events last for several days, so you may be able to try again the following day when viewing conditions have improved. Although rare, some conjunctions are bright enough to be visible in the daytime!

Photographing Planetary Conjunctions

If you like to take pictures, you may want to try your hand at photographing the planetary conjunctions you see. Astronomical objects photograph best in dark skies with little light pollution surrounding it, but they can sometimes come through in front of colorful sunsets. Staying out long enough to capture your planets in both sunset and night sky settings can make for some very interesting shots! If you do go with the dark sky option but want your planets to come off as brighter, see if your phone has a “night mode”. This will stabilize long exposure and make your darks look darker, providing a better contrast to the stars and planets . If using a DSLR camera, you can stabilize this exposure manually by using a tripod to get a sharper image. You can also make your image sharper by utilizing the Manual Focus mode. Finally, experiment with different lenses. A wide lens will allow you to capture more of the foreground and scenery of your viewing location, while a telephoto lens will give you a clearer, zoomed in shot. Capturing these events can be a challenging, but extremely rewarding experience!

4 Smart Safety Tips For Women While Camping

Photo Credit: Dziana Hasanbekava 
 
As is becoming increasingly common, women and those who identify as female who are flying solo on almost any activity are on high alert. About 70% of women who have ventured into the outdoors have taken a trip solo and unfortunately, about 66% of women have felt unsafe while recreating outdoors. For myself and others, some trips require more preparation for safety, so here are some tips to keep in mind for next time you’re out and about.

Pepper Spray Gel
 This one is a given, and one of the most popular self-defense accessories. While many people get the average pepper spray, I always think of a tip an old friend’s father gave me many years ago. While he was working as a detective for the local police station, he emphasized the importance of pepper spray gel rather than the traditional spray. You may be wondering what the difference is - Pepper spray gel is ejected in a much more concentrated stream, which expands the range considerably. This also prevents a common issue with classic pepper spray, in that it can sometimes inadvertently affect the person using it due to wind or simple mistakes - which can be quite common in a high-stress situation! . Pepper spray gel is usually more intense and has longer lasting side effects for the attacker than the classic, less concentrated spray.

Extra Pair of Shoes
 This is something I’ve learned through word of mouth for good practice when living alone, but I’ve found this to be a great idea for camping as well. The idea is to keep a spare pair of broken-in men’s shoes in the entryway of your home. You can usually purchase a cheap used pair at a local thrift store that’s properly worn-in. This will casually signal to any visitors, such as maintenance workers or the classic door-to-door salesman, that there is another person who lives in the residence - which could be enough to deter someone from any funny business. When I go camping, I usually leave my shoes outside of my tent to avoid dirt being tracked inside anyway. By also leaving a pair of men’s shoes outside your tent the same principle will apply as it would in your residence - signaling that there is another person with you to deter people targeting solo campers.

Lock Your Tent 

Most tents are not exactly secure - they typically don’t have locks, security systems, or anything of that nature. To solve this problem, when you are leaving your tent for the day, thread a padlock through the zipper track of your tent. While this is certainly not a foolproof method of securing your camp, it’s enough to help you determine whether your campsite has been disturbed during your absence. This same technique can be applied to the inside of your tent as well, since tents have zippers accessible from both sides of the entrance. Personally, this is something that makes me more comfortable to sleep at night - knowing that my vulnerable, sleeping state is literally protected by lock and key helps ease my racing mind.

Use Any/All Alarms
 This tip primarily applies to areas where there are other people around, such as a community campground, and is another concept adapted from one I frequently use at home. When car camping, keep your car keys close to where you’re sleeping. In event of an emergency, or if you feel unsafe for any reason, all you’d need to do is reach over and utilize the panic/alarm button that most vehicle key fobs have. The idea of using this when you’re at home, or at a campsite, is to create noise and call attention to your residence, which can be enough for an attacker to leave for fear of getting caught. I like this tip for any situation where your personal space is breached by an unwanted presence - and this certainly applies to your tent. It’s likely that you’ll already have your keys somewhere in your tent, but the important part is having them out and ready to be used in an emergency situation. 
 For those who may not have driven to their destination, but would still like to have something similar in case of emergency, try a panic keychain. This is a more compact option, but bear in mind that it’s generally not as loud, and may not bring as much attention as a car alarm. Again, these work best if used in an area where other people are around to help, so this might not be as effective during backcountry camping as it is when car camping. As the demand for safety items like these grow, they get more innovative. Check out this panic keychain by Blaire that not only has an ear piercing sound, but also an extremely bright strobe light that can temporarily blind a potential attacker. 
 These safety tips can extend to anyone who seeks an extra layer of protection when they are out and about. As the old saying goes, “better safe than sorry,” so keep these tips in mind - or even share them with some friends to utilize for their next trip!

There is no better way to immerse oneself in nature quite like backpacking. It is the ultimate way to hike and camp - teaching you the power of minimalism, self reliance, and solitude. Whether you’re alone or with a group, packing all your gear on your back and stepping into nature is truly a powerful experience. Backpacking is one of the closest experiences to being ‘off the grid’ that is achievable today. Every time I have stepped on a trail and surrendered to nature, I have found some new personal evolution. Here’s a list of the five most influential backpacking adventures I’ve encountered throughout my time in California. 

 
Kern River Trail - Sequoia National Forest

Where Mountain Highway 99 meets Forest Route 22S05; South Creek falls into the Kern River as it flows south - bound for Lake Isabella and eventually to the aqueducts of the San Joaquin Valley. The river starts high up in the snow as runoff from the mighty Mt. Whitney, growing as the runoff from other Sierra Nevada peaks merge with it - creating the eastern border of Sequoia National Park and rolling through the Sequoia National Forest. The Seven Teacups Trailhead was my entry point for this dazzling river. The trail is named after a geologic feature in which Dry Meadow Creek has created seven pools on its way to the Kern River. 

All along this trail - through beaches and forest groves there are well-established sites for setting up camp. Large granite boulders line the river, creating swimming holes and providing excellent opportunities for sunbathing. The first potential campsite is only a half mile from the trailhead, and the trail extends seven more miles along the river before cutting east into the mountains. For anyone in Los Angeles this is an ideal spot for a quick backpacking trip - less than 4 hours from city limits! Don’t forget to listen to Merle Haggard’s heartbreak ballad while floating in the Kern.


 
Boy Scout Trail - Joshua Tree National Park

Deep in the mighty Mojave Desert is the Boy Scout Trail - one of Joshua Tree’s most famous routes. The trail starts high in the boulder mountains of the northern portion of the park, and winds through Joshua Tree’s rich washes and rock gardens. The trail runs eight miles along the edge of the famous Wonderland of Rocks - a vast area packed with awe-inspiring outcroppings of rock and groves of cottonwood trees by desert springs. The Wonderland is governed by coyotes, with their communal howls heard late at night. 

Joshua Tree is well known for its stargazing, and doing so away from campgrounds and park roads only makes the beauty greater. Setting out from the Boy Scout Trailhead, bound north for Indian Cove Campground - starting in a forest of large Joshua Trees and marching toward the Wonderland of Rocks; the trail is an exceptional way to see the park’s natural beauty. With a network of small trails it is possible to explore the entirety of the Wonderland, though the area is closed at night out of caution for hikers - and to protect the Bighorn Sheep from being disturbed. This hike is strenuous but you don’t have to do the whole thing, camping is allowed a mile away from the trail head. Just be sure to listen to Iris DeMent and remember to be safe in the heat of the Mojave. 

 
Matilija Creek Trail - Matilija Canyon Wildlife Refuge

Matilija Canyon: Ojai, CA - Photo Credit: Scott Carnahan 

A rocky canyon full of the sweet smell of Chaparral mixed with Canyon Live Oak, a unique scent created by a very unique landscape; where the mountains, desert, and ocean meet. Fog dances between the ocean and the hills - creating cool humid mornings and hot arid afternoons. The canyon is created by Matilija Creek, winding down from its headwaters high up in the Los Padres National Forest. The Matilija Poppy is native to this canyon, and is the largest of all California’s native wildflowers. Black bear, cougar, bobcats, deer, coyotes, foxes, rabbits, and squirrels all can be found in the area; but most famously the California Condor is known to rest in the area, and was the main reason behind establishing the Matilija Wilderness. 

I embarked on this hike in early May - the creek was still running strong, and much of the flower life was still bright and beautiful. Depending on rain and temperature this area tends to become extremely dry early in the year, leaving it at risk for wildfire. The trail is primitive and it is easy to get turned around - keep an eye out for cairns to guide your way. Any bushwhacking you might have to do is worth it, and along the creek there are many nice places to set up camp, allowing ample water for filtration - just watch out for poison oak; ivy; and Poodle-Dog Bush. Simon and Garfunkel gave me a great vibe whilst sitting beside the campfire. 


 
Desolation Wilderness - Lake Tahoe

To the southwest of Lake Tahoe is an absolute Eden of rocky alpine lakes and glacial-carved granite. Pine forests populated by black bears, bobcats, chipmunks, squirrels, blue jays, and bald eagles - to name a few. The main route through the wilderness is a merger of two legendary trails: The Pacific Crest Trail and the Tahoe Rim Trail. This is a backpacking mecca, and permits can become scarce quickly - once on the trail you will understand! August is the hallmark month for this trip, as bugs are less common and temperatures are ideal. The amount of lakes in the wilderness is jaw dropping, and creates an excellent world for backpacking - consistently passing lakes eliminates the need to carry much water, and provides ample swimming opportunities as well. 

Entering the wilderness at Meeks Bay and exiting 30 miles later at Echo Lake was a perfect stretch to explore Desolation - camping at Rubicon Lake; Middle Velma Lake; Gilmore Lake, and Lake Aloha. Each lake provides bathing, swimming, and drinking opportunities after long hot days on the trail. Lake Aloha is often referred to as the ‘heart of the Desolation Wilderness’ and one look at it supports that claim.  It is the largest lake in the wilderness and houses an archipelago of granite islands. An amazing place for rock diving and swimming, I recommend spending more than one day at Lake Aloha...but be sure to Listen to John Prine’s ballad ‘Lake Marie’ while you're there. 

 
Santa Cruz Island - Channel Islands National Park

Just off the coast of Ventura, California are the remarkable Channel Islands - home to a diverse array of rare flora and fauna. Scientists believe the islands were never connected to the mainland, creating an isolated ecosystem with a wealth of unique resources that are found nowhere else on Earth. This park is a taste of what the coast of Southern California once was. The National Park includes five islands and a surrounding mile of ocean. This beautiful oceanside utopia is full of adventure on land or sea - scuba diving and ocean kayaking, or backpacking and camping - there are many ways to explore these majestic islands. The most common way to get to the islands is via boat, but for those airborne adventurous souls you can catch a plane. 

I took a boat that left from Ventura Harbor. The boat transit, which lasted more than an hour, doubles as a whale watching tour, and is a great way to be introduced to the park. Sailing up to the island invokes a fresh sense of adventure, and nothing is quite like stepping off onto the rocky beach with your bag on your back. Landing at Scorpion Cove and hiking thirteen miles to the Del Norte backcountry campground was a strenuous (though rewarding) trek. Hiking the island’s ridge was an exhilarating experience, looking out on the Pacific on either side. But nothing that beats seeing the rare Island Fox in its natural habitat. The fox is native only to six of Southern California’s islands (three of which are in the park) - they are smaller than your average fox and their curiosity was obvious as they danced and played alongside my tired legs. 

Santa Cruz Island is a marvelous locale for exploration, and the experience was absolutely unforgettable. Enjoying a post-hike beer on the boat back to the mainland, watching blue whales flap their tails, I sailed back with appreciation in my heart for the unique adventure that is found on the Channel Islands. If you are going to hike anything before you die, Santa Cruz Island is a worthy place to go - just ask Weezer...

Pets in Parks: 6 Helpful Tips for Camping and Hiking with Your Dog
What to know before bringing your furry friend on your next outdoor trip

We love dogs here at Pathloom - our dogs, your dogs, any dogs! Most parks are more than happy to welcome yourself and your furry friends in developed areas, but there are certainly some things to keep in mind when planning your trip. Rules and regulation vary depending on your destination, so it’s always a good idea to check the Park’s website before heading out. Here are some useful tips for you and your fuzzy buddy wherever you end up - accompanied by some of our favorite good boys and good girls submitted by the Pathloom community! 

Want to show off your dog too? Send us a photo with location and your dog's name to blog@pathloom.com and we may feature your pup in a future article!

Packing for a Pet

When embarking on an outdoor adventure with your pet, it is just as important to prepare for their needs as it is to prepare for your own. When traveling with pets, it is a good idea to keep a copy of vaccination records, or any important documents that pertain to your furry friend’s health. In addition to these, don’t forget to carry a recent picture of your pet - if you're anything like us you may have one or two (thousand) on your phone, and this can be very helpful in case your pet gets lost or separated from you! Since leashes are required in all National Parks and most public places as well, this means your pet will need to wear a collar at all times. The collar should have accurate tags and contact information, again in case they wander away from you.

Pet Admission

Most National Parks allow pets in common areas, campsites and paved roads (though keep in mind many prohibit them in less developed areas). Some even have unique features to offer for them, such as the B.A.R.K Rangers Program. The National Park Service offers a map that shows which parks allow pets, as well as the few that do not. With this map, you can select the park you plan on bringing your furry friend to, which will direct you to the specific pet rules and regulations for that park. 

If you’re looking for a special day to spend with your pet, the National Park Service also offers a “Things To Do” Bulletin for unique pet events at the Parks!

Convenience is Key

While you’re out on approved trails with your pet, you’ll have to pack some extra items in addition to your normal solo travel bag. It is essential to keep your pets on a leash during your entire visit to a National Park. For more experienced dogs, we recommend this amazing retractable leash that compacts into the collar -  ideal for steep slopes or climbs that you may face, where dragging a leash may be dangerous. 

Nourishment is important to energy levels in order to have a happy, healthy hike. Collapsible silicone bowls are a very simple option that can clip onto the strap of your backpack. These bowls can be used for water,  or to provide some pre-packed food in a fast and space-efficient way. Another option is this water bottle, which allows you to keep your pet hydrated without wasting water after they’ve quenched their thirst. 

A common preparation for hikers is to have first aid materials on hand in case of emergency, and this extends to pets as well. This pet first aid kit is veterinary certified, and can even strap onto your pet’s harness to prevent additional weight on your own pack.

Always clean up after your pet 

A small pet disposal bag holder is easy to clip right next to the silicon bowls, or onto the leash itself. These are helpful to have on the go, but disposal of used bags is of the utmost importance - it should be done properly, without exception, with the rest of your trash in the designated dumping areas. Leaving used bags along the trails can be harmful for wildlife and disruptive to the environment, and makes for a less pleasant experience for the visitors who follow.

Personal Pet Needs

Remember that different terrains can require different equipment for your furry friend. If you’re planning on visiting rough terrain, look into some dog booties to protect their paws from damage (There’s the added bonus here of watching their first try-on for some wholesome humor!) If you have an energetic dog, remember to bring some toys to keep them busy during the travel time in the car.

Pet Best Practices

With pets as with humans, Leave No Trace principles apply, so it’s important to leave the space you’re in just how you left it. The National Park Service encourages campers and their furry friends to follow these principles with the previously mentioned “B.A.R.K Ranger” program, which outlines simple responsibilities for pet owners - like bagging your pet’s waste, always keeping your pet on a leash, respecting wildlife, and knowing where you’re permitted to take your buddy. Remember, failure to comply with park pet policy can result in fines or tickets! 

Some parks, like Indiana Dunes National Park offer the opportunity for your pup to become a “B.A.R.K Ranger Ambassador” through volunteer programs to advocate for these best practices to fellow hikers and fur babies. 

For our RV explorers, our friends over at Porch.com compiled a great list of tips for traveling with your pets from a panel of experts on the subject (including us!) Check it out here!

With the right preparation, bringing your pet with you on adventures can be seamless and stress-free. The Outdoors is for everyone - even your furry friends!

"Across America, there were a total of 237 million visitors to National Parks during 2020. This was a decrease of 28% from the previous year, likely due to pandemic-related closures and restrictions by local governments in the areas surrounding our parks."

(published 3/11/2021)

"Too much empty floor space inside your tent will make it hard to warm up the interior space. Bring your backpack and other gear inside (avoid  sharp items that could rip your tent, like crampons and axes), and place everything around you on the floor of your tent to act as insulation against the cold ground."

Taken From: Winter Backcountry Camping Guide, Part 2 - Gear Guide 
(published 3/18/21)

"Keep in mind that the ground steals heat from your body, even more so in the winter months, so you will need to invest in a high quality sleeping pad. Your best bet is to use two pads to keep you warm on snowy ground - a foam pad next to the ground, and an inflatable pad on top to maximize your insulation from the cold below."

Taken From: Gems of the South - From the Blue Ridge to the Bayou 
(published 3/29/21)

"The best way to see the Park is by kayaking or canoeing the famous Cedar Creek. In the heart of the flood plain water levels can vary by up to 10 feet, making it very important to check the water level before setting out for a creek-bound adventure."

Zion National Park Climbing Closures

Zion National Park is temporarily closing cliffs in the park for the 2021 breeding season of Peregrine Falcons, expected to last until late July. These birds were critically endangered in 2017, but their complete extinction was prevented due to conservation efforts similar to Zion’s closures. Biologists and volunteers from the parks will monitor the breeding and nesting for these birds and determine precise reopening date based on the new chicks’ development, and when they are ready to leave the nest. The Peregrine Falcon prefers nesting on high ledges with territorial tendencies during this time, and Zion National Park is committed to harboring sanctuary for these and other wildlife. 

Beginning March 1, the following cliffs will be closed to climbing: Angels Landing, Cable Mountain, The Great White Throne, Isaac (in the Court of the Patriarchs), The Sentinel, Mountain of the Sun, North Twin Brother, Tunnel Wall, The Easy Temple, Mount Spry, The Streaked Wall, and Mount Kinesava. Hikers need not be alarmed - if one of the aforementioned cliffs lies along a marked hiking trail, the trail itself is expected to remain open during this time. Climbing in this context is considered bouldering or scaling.

Parks begin Spring Cleaning and Maintenance 

Several National Parks are expected to engage in some tender love and care over the next few weeks, which can cause closures and delays in plans. Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park is expected to perform maintenance on 4 different roads, and begin vegetation management in the Park that could last until mid-April. Yellowstone National Park experienced road closures due to excessive snow. Over winter, roads were open only to oversnow travel using snowmobiles or snow coaches, but will reopen to normal vehicle traffic once plowing efforts have been completed. If the weather permits, some roads plan to reopen to automobile traffic in mid-April. This will likely extend to more National Parks as Spring begins, so check for traffic and road closures before beginning any travels where weather could be an issue.

Arches National Park Identified as a Leave No Trace Hotspot

Arches National Park in Southern Utah is one of ten parks selected to be a Hot Spot by the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics. In March (and again in September), a Leave No Trace team worked directly with these parks to share information with visitors, land managers, volunteers and locals on how to recreate responsibly to reduce impact on the outdoors. Programs involving Leave No Trace education are free, and will be open for public attendance. LNT identifies Hot Spot locations by focusing on popular outdoor spaces across the United States that are seeing an increase in recreational use, and subsequent human impact. This impact can be seen through excessive trash, damage to vegetation, trail erosion, disturbance to wildlife and more. Regardless of whether you plan to visit Arches or any of the other specific Hot Spot parks this year, you can help support your favorite National Parks and outdoor spaces by following the Leave No Trace Principles wherever you go!

Cold Weather Temperature Alert for Boaters and Paddlers

Cape Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina is reminding visitors recreating offshore that the water temperature is dangerously colder than the air temperature. Spring weather begins to increase the air temperatures, but water temperatures may take until the end of April to warm to safe levels. Check with your coastal park for any water temperature advisories before packing a bathing suit. Spending too much time in excessively cold water can lead to hypothermia, serious breathing issues while in the water, and more severe cold shock effects - especially for senior citizens. Protect yourself against these temps by wearing a wetsuit, or otherwise properly equipping yourself if you’ll be on the water. The U.S. Coast Guard suggests that those doing any sort of boating on bodies of water be sure to wear life jackets, and keep a VHF-FM radio nearby for emergency use.

United States and Ireland Sign Sister Park Agreement

The United States and Ireland have officially come together via a virtual ceremony to establish Glacier National Park in Montana and Killarney National Park in County Kerry, Ireland as “sister parks”. Through this agreement, the Parks plan to work collaboratively to share best practices of technical and professional knowledge, data, technology, and training; possibly coordinating visits as well. This agreement follows notice of the parks seeing similar issues derived from excessively high foot traffic from visitors. The issues also address ecological concerns, such as controlling exotic and invasive wildlife, local outreach, and ecological monitoring.

Parks Prepare for Camping Season With COVID-19 Precautions

For many parks, camping season typically begins each year on April 1st. This year many have prepared their campgrounds for opening by allowing campers to reserve their site online prior to arrival. If reservations are an option for your local campsite, give it a try! Furthermore, most of the campsites that offer reservations also have a non-contact check-in feature. Some parks are able to accommodate walk-in registration, but it would be best to reach out to your specific campground for more information.

Bipartisan Bill Introduced to increase funding for Recreational Trails

Vermont Representative Peter Welch (D) and Utah Representative John Curtis ® have reintroduced legislation to increase the funding set aside for The Recreational Trails Program. This funding was first granted in 1991, and was most recently introduced to the United States Congress in 2020 but did not receive votes. This bill proposes to nearly triple the funding that is currently allocated, from $83 million to $230 million. 

This supports general maintenance, and the development of trails for hiking, bicycling, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling and 4-wheel driving for Americans and their families. Representative Welch has mentioned that “The coronavirus pandemic has only increased Americans’ interest in getting outside to appreciate the recreational opportunities throughout the country,” and an increase in funding will help future generations enjoy the same trails and experiences. This bill is currently supported by 11 other representatives.

Winter Backcountry Camping Guide (Part 3)
Food and Hydration

This is part 3 of Jack’s Winter Backcountry Camping Guide - if you missed the previous editions of this series, check out Part 1 to read up on Trip Planning &amp; Safety, and Part 2 for an overview of cold-weather gear needs! 

 
The final installment of our series on backcountry camping deals with food and hydration. Food is obviously important, and can be one of the most fun parts of winter camping, as long as you do it right. Usually, you’ll have a bit of wiggle room with fair-season food and water considerations, but it’s a different game in the winter. If you’re going to be out in the cold backcountry, you’ll want to be extra careful with the type of food you’ll be bringing, mostly to keep weight and fuel savings in mind.

Setting up your camp kitchen in the summer is pretty easy - you just find a flat piece of ground, build a fire or set up your stove, and cook away. Winter requires a different approach. It is imperative that you make a sheltered area to prepare your meals. It would be a good idea to shovel out a table and seats if the snow conditions call for it. This may seem like a lot for an overnight trip, but it will really make the difference. While this isn’t necessarily a requirement, there are plenty of options out there.

Your Winter Kitchen
If you opt to cook over a fire rather than a stove, dig a small hole in the snow first, then put down some sticks. The fire will make the snow below melt and the fire will sink, so it’s a good idea to have something underneath that will prevent the fire from being extinguished by melting snow.
If you’re choosing to cook on a camp stove, use an old computer mousepad beneath the stove to stop the snow from melting underneath.
Take advantage of your stove’s windscreen and heat reflector. Also, don’t be afraid to get creative and make homemade koozies for your cookware. To make a koozie, I like to use an insulation material called Reflectix. You can use this material for a variety of things other than making koozies as well.
Butane and propane won’t work very well in cold temperatures. Alcohol stoves also have problems in the cold. It would be a good idea to put your fuel canister(s) in your jacket to warm them up prior to cooking.
Some alcohol stoves come with a built-in winter priming plate that helps warm up the fuel before you ignite it. This is a lifesaver in cold temperatures.
Stoves that you need priming for work great, so white gas stoves are best. Remember, liquid gas quickly becomes the same temperature as the air upon exposure, and you can easily get frostbite if you spill it on your bare skin in subzero temperatures.

Staying Hydrated
Dehydration can be a major issue when winter camping. It can lead to severe fatigue and can speed up the onset of hypothermia. However, gathering water, not only for drinking but also for making meals, is a challenge. Melting snow over a campfire or stove is definitely an option, but this takes a lot of time and fuel to do so, and the water will have a strange taste to it. To address this, try aerating the water by pouring it from one container to another - this should give some good flavor back to your water.
If a natural water source is covered by ice, not to worry! Start chiseling the ice from the outside and work your way in, moving around in a full circle.
If you have time, and it’s one of those sunny late-winter days, place a black tarp out in the open, atop the snow. Create a depression in the center, and place a layer of snow on it - the sun should melt the snow in a couple of hours.
Obviously, try to pack-in as much water as possible to avoid these sticky situations. Try to use an insulated container to store water while you’re traveling. 
To keep your water from freezing overnight, store the thermos inside your sleeping bag or bury it outside in a snowbank, upside down so if it does begin to freeze the ice will be at the bottom of the container. The snow should insulate it enough to keep it from freezing solid.
No matter how desperate you may be, never eat snow for hydration. It is a myth that snow will rehydrate your body - in fact it does the complete opposite.

Food Considerations
Nutritious food is more critical than ever when the temperature plummets. Your body burns calories a lot faster in colder weather. If you’re going to be out there for any length of time, you will need to ensure you’re eating at least 5,000 to 6,000 calories per day. 
You will want to look for foods that are very high in protein. Stews, chili, shepherd’s pie, and basically any kind of nut butter are all good options for winter camping as they will fill you up with plenty of calories.
Sandwiches for the day (PB&amp;J, honey, deli meat, cheese or even Nutella) can be made up in the morning and kept in an insulated bag alongside a thermos of hot water for tea, soup or hot chocolate.
Crackers or freshly baked bannock are far better than sliced bread (which will easily freeze). Dry treats like shortbread won’t freeze either.
Remember that the fewer steps and less prep time, the better. Chances are you’ll be too cold or tired to bother with extensive cooking times, not to mention that stove fuel burns off more quickly in cold temperatures.

When you pack your food for a winter trip, it’s crucial that you count your calories carefully and portion out your snacks and meals in advance. The last thing you want is to find yourself eating less because you didn’t pack enough food. This will seriously wear you down in the cold weather and could create many more problems than you anticipate. With that said, don’t be afraid to pack some of your favorite foods. At the end of the day you’ll want to consume your calories without issue, so making sure that you’re packing food that you enjoy will do wonders for your morale!

Winter Backcountry Camping Guide, Part 2
Gear Guide

In this chapter of our Winter Backcountry Camping series, we will go over the essential gear to keep you comfortable in the face of harsh elements. Two simple rules of winter camping: stay dry, and stay warm. Having the right gear for your trip can be critical to your enjoyment when you’re out in the cold for extended periods of time. The required gear for winter camping is similar to what you’d take fair-weather backpacking - but prioritizes warmth and durability. 

Cold-weather camping is an unparalleled experience, provided you do some research, plan carefully, and pack smartly. The correct sleeping bag, pad, tent and clothing, along with some miscellaneous items will have you prepared for an unforgettable late-winter excursion. Keep in mind that this is not a complete checklist of backpacking and camping gear, but rather the essentials you need on top of your fair-weather kit to make a winter camping trip in the backcountry successful.

If you haven’t already, be sure to check out the first part of our Winter Backcountry Camping series, which covers trip planning and safety.

Clothing

Having the right clothing, and managing your layers appropriately, is the key to comfort while winter camping. It’s important to plan out exactly what you’re going to wear in advance, before you go out in the cold.
Your base layer will be the first item of clothing to consider - your underwear layer that goes next to your skin. For winter camping, midweight long underwear is a good choice for all-around use - though you can of course adjust the weight according to the conditions you’ll be in. You’ll want to opt for fabrics like polyester or wool that wick water away from your skin and dry quickly. Remember, avoid cotton at all costs. Once cotton gets wet, it will not wick properly - which can be extremely dangerous in cold-weather conditions.
Your middle layer is crucial because it helps you maintain body heat. For your upper body, you can’t go wrong with a synthetic insulated jacket or a down jacket. If you prefer the comfort of fleece, it would be a good idea to use a heavyweight fleece jacket. For your legs, fleece pants are a great option.
You will want to consider an outer layer that will protect you from snow, rain and wind alike. For winter camping, you will absolutely need a fully waterproof jacket and pants. If you skimp out on this part, you will run the risk of water penetrating your layers - which can lead to hypothermia. With that said, these items also need to be breathable enough to wick perspiration away from your body.
Your socks play an important role in your enjoyment of the backcountry. Always remember that “cotton kills,” so it’s a great idea to wear wool socks. This old adage isn’t just for socks - it applies for every piece of clothing you bring out into the backcountry. Also, don’t forget to bring a pair of back-up socks - better to have and not need, than need and not have!
Never sleep in the same clothes that you hiked in. Make sure you have a dry set of clothes to change into for sleeping.
You’ll also want to think about accessories like a winter hat, gloves, goggles, boots, down socks, buff and crampons/microspikes.
Since you’ll be carrying more than usual, make sure your pack has enough volume to hold all of your gear. We would suggest a 65 liter pack to start with.

Campsite and Kitchen
 Your campsite is your temporary home for the night, so it’s important to make it as cozy as possible - yet functional too! From your sleeping bag to your stove, your gear plays a critical role in your enjoyment of the night.
It’s crucial to have a tent that will handle winter weather. Your typical 3-season tent can work if the conditions aren’t too harsh, but if you’re going to encounter high wind and/or heavy snowfall, then it would be a good idea to invest in a 4-season tent. With that said, you will want some extra space in your tent since you’ll be carrying more gear than usual. Bring some extra stakes and rope for tie-downs too, in case it gets windy.
Your sleeping bag is another crucial item in your pack. You will want to use a sleeping bag that is rated at least 10°F lower than the coldest temperature you expect to see in your region. Down, as opposed to synthetic, is the best choice for winter bags as they provide the best warmth for their weight. 
Sleeping pads provide essential insulation and cushioning from the hard, cold earth. Keep in mind that the ground steals heat from your body, even more so in the winter months, so you will need to invest in a high quality sleeping pad. Your best bet is to use two pads to keep you warm on snowy ground - a foam pad next to the ground, and an inflatable pad on top to maximize your insulation from the cold below.
Like any other camping trip, bring your stove. You may even want to bring a backup stove, just in case your primary one malfunctions - it’s especially important in a cold-weather situation to have the peace of mind to know that your stove situation is 100%. Keep in mind that it takes extra fuel to melt snow for drinking water, and remember that you’ll use more fuel at higher elevations. Always make a base for your stove, preventing a melty mess and ensuring that your food will be safe.
If you’re in bear territory, make sure your food-hanging system is in good order. 
Always bring extra water purifying tablets in addition to your water filter. We will go further in-depth into hydration in Part 3 of this series.

Miscellaneous (Navigation, Emergency)
 These are crucial items for cold weather backcountry excursions that don’t really fit in the other categories. With that said, you’ll notice that you will be bringing quite a lot of gear with you, so make sure to be mindful of your belongings - and always practice Leave No Trace Principles.
Bring a good headlamp with fresh batteries. You’ll want plenty of light to deal with winter’s long nighttime hours. In fact, bring extra batteries for all of the electronics in your pack - the cold temperatures will drain power quicker than you think! If possible, sleep with your electronics and batteries in your sleeping bag to help insulate them from this power drain.
Don’t forget sunglasses and sunscreen. Reflective snow can cook you, especially from late February on! It can be easy to overlook, but just because the temperatures are low doesn’t mean UV rays can’t do their damage.
Bring along both matches and a lighter to start your campfire and stove. It’s always a good idea to bring both, just in case one fails.
Even if you planned your trip from A to Z, you’ll still want to bring paper maps and compasses just in case. 
If the area you’re going into is extremely remote or otherwise dangerous, utilizing a personal locator beacon could mean the difference between life or death.

There is so much gear needed for a successful cold weather backcountry trip that it may seem a little too daunting - not to mention that all of this gear can get fairly pricey! But don’t despair - there are many cheap ways to obtain proper equipment. Discount retailers are hard to find in the hiking/camping space, but they are definitely still out there. Shopping the sales at Moosejaw can get you great bang-for-your-buck, and Steep&amp;Cheap, REI Outlet &amp; Used Gear, and Campsaver are all great resources to find inexpensive used gear. Also, there are always people trying to get rid of lightly used gear on eBay and Craigslist, so don’t count those out! Cold-weather gear is definitely an investment, and not one you want to go bargain-basement on - “you get what you pay for” never rings more true than in a situation like this - but with enough research you can find high quality options that won’t break the bank.

As long as you carefully plan - and double-check your gear before heading out - you will be well-suited to face the elements. Although winter camping demands more preparation and gear, you’ll realize that it’s all worth it. You’re in complete solitude with nobody else around except for your close friends - what’s better than that?

Winter Backcountry Camping Guide (Part 1)
Trip Planning &amp; Safety

Hiking and camping popularity has skyrocketed amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. While it’s great that more people are spending time outside, some of the areas where you previously found tranquility are far busier than usual. If you want to beat the crowds and avoid the bugs, then winter backcountry camping is just for you! This is for the folks who live in areas where the winters get cold, and where people flock to trails and campsites during the spring months. It’s mid-March, there isn’t a ton of winter left, start planning now so you can get out and experience it while you still can! 

Camping in cold weather is truly something special, it’s pure winter peacefulness. To make sure that you’re ready for your next winter campout, you must count on your fair-weather camping skills, and adapt to the new challenges snowy landscapes and cold temperatures will bring. Winter camping is indeed an entirely different animal than fair-weather camping, but you’re still going to need to apply the skills you’ve gained camping during the summer months. 

This will be the first of a three-part series based on backcountry camping during the wintertime. Part 1 will cover proper preparation and safety measures, regardless of the conditions. Part 2, coming next Thursday, will focus on the gear you’ll need, while Part 3 (coming the following week) will help you select the proper food and hydration methods for your excursion. In addition to this Guide series, earlier this winter we posted an article on the Pathloom Blog featuring some of our team’s favorite tips and tricks for camping and hiking in cold weather, you can check that out here.

Know Before You Go

Spending a night in a tent surrounded by snow may not seem like the ultimate winter getaway, but if you play your cards right it won’t be nearly as cold and miserable as it may sound. Above all else, you must recognize that this environment has the potential to be extremely dangerous. It takes careful trip planning in order to hike and camp safely in this setting. Therefore, it is crucial to spend a good amount of time researching locations and conditions to figure out when, where and how you will accomplish this trip. 

Know the weather forecast and think about the region you’ll be in. Different weather patterns and climates call for different gear and preparation, so you’ll need to study up in advance to be fully prepared for your trip. With that said, high winds can become a serious issue and can lead to icy conditions - so make sure to study the wind forecast as well!
If you’re not very experienced with backcountry camping in the wintertime, take it slow. It’s crucial to be fully prepared, so start with shorter trails in areas that aren’t very desolate before working your way up. Be sure to plan multiple escape routes in advance, in case of an emergency.
As with any outdoor activity, tell people where you are going. Share a plan with friends and family, and provide them with precautionary measures for what to do in case they do not hear from you. Sort out what to do in a worst case scenario - i.e. how long they should go without hearing from you before they should call for help.
If you’re able to, talk to a ranger. Ask them about the current conditions in the area, and if there’s anything to look out for before planning any trip into the backcountry. If the snow is deep, they may suggest hiking in the morning to avoid post-holing. 
Food, water and gear are critical considerations for winter camping, and could mean the difference between life or death. Parts two and three of this Winter Backcountry Camping Guide will dive deeper into these topics, so keep an eye out in the coming weeks!

Protecting Yourself

Now that you’ve planned your trip carefully, it’s time to learn some techniques to protect yourself, to make your experience the best it can be. You’ll find that most of your fair-weather camping skills will transfer over nicely. However, much of winter camping is about having the right gear (which we’ll get into during part two of the series). That being said, keeping these tips in mind will give you an extra leg-up, no matter what gear you’re working with.

Be familiar with your route. You and every member of your group should be knowledgeable of the trails and local area. If you are using electronics for navigation, it would be a good idea to bring a backup paper map - just in case.
Camp near open water if possible, so you don’t have to spend all your time melting snow. If you’ll need to melt snow, plan on using three times as much fuel as you would use for normal summer camping.
The biggest difference between winter camping and regular camping is that you’ll possibly be setting up your tent on snow. Don’t be afraid of this - snow works great as a stable foundation. It’s important to examine potential campsites thoroughly before setting up camp for the night. 
Wind protection is your friend. Try to find a hill or a patch of trees to set up your tent. This will make your night much warmer and more enjoyable. Find the right balance - keep your tent close enough to block the wind, but be sure to have enough distance from the trees to avoid snow-covered branches falling onto your tent.
Try not to camp on vegetation, it can disturb or possibly even kill many plant species. Try your best to find a nice patch of snow or bare ground to set up camp.
Beware of hazards like avalanches and unstable trees. Make sure your tent is set up far away from any slopes that might slide.
Turn around frequently to survey your route. Make sure you’ll be able to recognize it easily on the way out, should snow or wind obscure your tracks. This is a good idea in all seasons, but especially so in winter conditions.
Too much empty floor space inside your tent will make it hard to warm up the interior space. Bring your backpack and other gear inside (avoid sharp items that could rip your tent, like crampons and axes), and place everything around you on the floor of your tent to act as insulation against the cold ground. 
It is completely fine to turn around if you feel like you’re getting lost or struggling with the cold. Don’t try to be a hero, there will be plenty more opportunities to camp again!

Dealing With Injuries and Illnesses in the Cold
 In case you haven’t realized already, cold-weather camping far away from civilization can bring many risks. It’s important to regularly check on yourself and others in your group, so your peaceful trip doesn’t turn into a nightmare.

Hypothermia and frostbite are serious concerns when backcountry camping in the winter. To manage this, you must know the symptoms and actively check up on yourself and your partners on a regular basis.
Do not try to work through pain. Chances are you are probably far away from any help, so if you feel your fingers and toes getting cold, stop what you are doing immediately and try your best to warm them up. Frostbite and hypothermia set in faster than you may think.
Start warm and stay warm. Dressing with appropriate layers will ensure a comfortable body temperature. Make sure your layers are in order before going out, because trying to get warm is much more difficult than just staying warm!
Again, it is completely fine to turn around if you feel like you’re getting lost or struggling with the cold. Don’t try to be a hero!

That wraps up the initial entry of our Winter Backcountry Camping Guide - some basic tips on how to prepare for your next camping trip. Enjoy this opportunity to be out in nature, and let the brisk air and stark landscape help you feel alive. Tune in next Thursday for the next part of this series, where we highlight the different types of gear you will need to have a safe trip out in the backcountry.

NPS Implements Mask Mandates in all Parks and Federal Buildings

In late January, President Biden signed an executive order requiring all federal workforces to wear masks to support slowing the spread of COVID-19. This requirement extends to all employees, partners, contractors - and visitors too - effective as of February 2. Face coverings are required in all buildings and facilities, and on managed lands where 6 feet of physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as on crowded/narrow trails. Some areas may see limited capacity, trail changes, or possible closures based on local legislation and compliance. The National Park Service recommends checking the website of the individual park for more information on their operations.

Youth Conservation Corps Applications Open For Summer 2021

The Youth Conservation Corps is a work opportunity for youth around their local National Parks, that allows those ages 15-18 to work alongside National Park Rangers on park conservation efforts. This program usually spans 8 to 10 weeks, and pays minimum wage for a 40-hour work week. Applications are available for submission online, or you can stop into your local National Park to inquire about positions in-person. This is an amazing opportunity that provides youth the chance to learn about future careers with the National Park Service, as well as developing valuable and transferable work experience for future job opportunities in other fields.

National Parks are beginning prescribed fires ahead of the upcoming dry summers that commonly produce wildfires. Parks that are beginning these controlled burns this month include, but are not limited to: Zion National Park, Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, Rocky Mountain National Park, and Southern Florida Parks and Reserves. These efforts are carefully coordinated with parks and fire experts, taking into account weather and other conditions for proper and safe impacts/dispersal. Due to these prescribed burns, there may be areas within parks closed on short notice - but these closures typically don't last longer than one day.

National Parks Seeking Volunteers

Guadalupe National Park is currently seeking Texans to volunteer three months of their time to act as a point-of-contact for visitors, performing daily water testing, safety oversight, and possibly assisting in search and rescue efforts as well. These positions require participants to commit to working 32 hours per week, and background/reference checks will be run prior to onboarding. An RV/trailer with a bathroom will be provided for living arrangements for the duration of the assignment. There are 3 host positions for 3 different campgrounds within Guadalupe open through October-December of 2021, and interested parties should apply via volunteer.gov.

Guadalupe is not the only National Park that has sought out support from local communities. More information about volunteering with your local parks can be found through the National Park Service website, or by directly reaching out to the park you desire to support.

NPS Announces New Guidelines for Filming in Parks

The National Park Service has updated their regulations and processes around filming in national parks as a response to Price v. Barr. This allows for low-impact filming without any advance notice or permits. Low-impact filming is defined as filming in areas open to the public in groups of five or less, using equipment that must be carried at all times (with the exception of a small tripod to hold a camera.) This rule does not apply to areas considered congressionally-designated wilderness. 

All filming opportunities that are considered non-low impact must give at least 10 days’ notice to the National Park Service by directly communicating with the park you plan on filming in. There are situations where permits may be required, and if you’re unsure check with the park rangers just in case.

11 Historic Resources Designated to Civil Rights Network

In honor of Black History Month, The National Park Service has added 11 locations and programs that were monumental during the African American Civil Rights Movement. These 11 additions join the growing list of systems and sites that chronicle the movement, now ranging from coast to coast. Currently, the African American Civil Rights Network has a total of 45 entities, including 18 national parks to present commemorative spaces and interpretations in honor of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. 
 The additions are Glenwood Cemetery (AL), Tabernacle Baptist Church- Selma (AL), Second Baptist Church Los Angeles (CA), COFO Civil Rights Education Center (MS), Margaret Walker Center (MS), The Harriet and Stephen Myers Residence (NY), Racing Change- Oregon’s Civil Rights Years (OR), Equalization Schools Website (SC), Harden Street Substation (SC), St. George Rosenwald School (SC), and Waverly Historic District (SC).

$70.7M Granted in Historic Preservation Efforts to States &amp; Tribes

Annual appropriations from the Historic Preservation Funds are broken down and listed on the National Park Service’s website. These funds are designated for the preservation of cultures for future generations, and education to enhance the learning of these cultures. These funds, granted by congress on an annual basis since the 1970’s, are not taxpayer money, but instead are collected through royalties from energy companies. $55.7 million will be allocated to preservation grants for states, territories, and partnering nations. The remaining $15 million will be given to 200 tribal offices for the purpose of historical preservation.

State and National Parks Converting to Online-Only Reservations

As reported in January’s National Park News, many campgrounds closed due to the pandemic are beginning to welcome back visitors. This has recently been seen in New Mexico State Parks, Rocky Mountain Campgrounds, South Dakota State Parks (with the exception of Custer State Park), and many more. These and many other national and state parks are now requiring online reservations to be made prior to arrival. When making reservations, be sure to look into policies around your potential vacation spot, since some must be purchased a certain amount of time in advance. Planning ahead for these trips is a great habit to get into in order to ensure a seamless experience.

National Parks Have Released 2020 Visitation Report

Across America, there were a total of 237 million visitors to National Parks during 2020. This was a decrease of 28% from the previous year, likely due to pandemic-related closures and restrictions by local governments in the areas surrounding our parks. Over 60 national parks were closed for two or more months.

Where the West Begins
Riding the edge of the Great Plains

Holy Cross Church, Pine Ridge Reservation - Photo Credit: Scott Carnahan 
 
With hills of fresh white snow glimmering in the sun of a beautiful October day, I crossed into Nebraska via the Pine Ridge Reservation and onto Nebraska State Highway 87. Blue skies above the Nebraska National Forest were a friendly welcome to the Cornhusker State. I was surprised by the nation's 37th state, assuming the Great Plains to be just that - rather plain, but the panhandle of Nebraska is full of gems. I'd soon find a whole new sense of awe for Nebraskaland, "Where the west begins".

Buttes and bulls make up Nebraska's bootheel that extends over Colorado. Covered in a layer of snow, the Great Plains were uniquely beautiful; and each surprising geologic formation that I passed made this state of rivers and prairies even more charming. Cascading over rolling hills, winding through rich forests, I eventually coasted into Chadron, NE. I was sure to apologize to the state of Nebraska for all judgements before my visit as I pulled south onto U.S. 385, 'The Gold Rush Byway'.

Nebraska's fertile ground was home to humankind for thousands of years before European colonizers arrived. The historic tribes such as Pawnee, Omaha, Missouria, and some branches of the Lakota had established trade routes and settlements long before Spain, Britain, and France began contending for “control” of the area. The 1700s were wrought with conflict as the European powers formed treaties with the tribes, using them as pawns in another chess game of the New World. 

By 1819 the United States was moving westward, and the first American fort was built in the area. The California Gold Rush began in 1848 and settlers on their journey west poured through the Great Plains to chase their golden dreams; via a broken wagon wheel or passion for the land many stayed to pursue the Cornhusker lifestyle. On May 30, 1854 U.S. Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, creating the Kansas and Nebraska territories. Portions of what is today Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana were all included in the Nebraska territory, the capital established in Omaha.

After the U.S. forced the Native American tribes to give up their lands and live on reservations in the late 1860s, huge portions of land were opened up for settlers. Via Homestead Acts the government opened up 160 million acres of public land for free to 1.6 million homesteaders. Any adult that never fought against the United States was eligible to apply, including Black Americans, Women, and Immigrants who had applied for citizenship. With roughly 10% of the country's land up for grabs after being stolen from the natives, there was a mass migration west. Taking the shape we know today, Nebraska became a state on March 1st, 1867.

With the sun fading in fall splendor, I wound my domicile-on-wheels through the canyons of the famed Pine Ridge and made camp in Chadron State Park. Nebraska's first state park, Chadron is one of the region's preeminent hiking and mountain biking destinations. Over 100 miles of handsome trails and vintage roads provide a range of options for everyone, and a pine view swimming pool is open all summer long. If you're feeling fancy, the park also offers 22 cabins for rent; they come with air conditioning, heating, and are fully furnished with all the essentials for a proper Nebraska cabin experience.

Beyond hiking and biking, Chadron State Park hosts many other activities, such as paddle boating, disc golf, and sand volleyball. Historical programs run by the park offer a greater glimpse at the area's fascinating history, which can be lived out by taking a horseback trail ride and stopping off at the trading post. In winter Chadron is a popular place for sledding, and I wished there was time on my trip for a good sled ride - but instead I compromised with a foil wrapped campfire dinner and mulled wine while listening to Bruce Springsteen's "Nebraska" album.

If you're a butte man like myself...No, get your head out of the gutter. I mean Buttes with an e, the geologic formation created by erosion when stronger rock exists above less resistant rock, creating pinnacles that stand above plains and deserts. Nebraska's panhandle is full of a variety of these, the most famous being Chimney Rock - for fans of the video game Oregon Trail, this is a familiar name. During the migration west, Chimney Rock was a key landmark on the Mormon, California, and Oregon trails. U.S. Route 26 follows the old Oregon Trail and runs past the butte to the north on its way west, where it eventually ends on the Oregon coast in Astoria, OR. My inner third-grader was ecstatic upon seeing Chimney Rock as it brought back all the memories of dysentery, fording rivers, and death of digital oxen. To finally see the butte in person was a moment akin to making it to the trail's end in the video game.

Not far from Chimney Rock is Scotts Bluff National Monument, a mixed prairie and badlands landscape full of buttes that runs along the North Platte River. I didn't have time to swing through the park, but decided it would be a good trip to make next time. The monument protects over 3,000 acres, and is loaded with remnants of historic overland trails that carried over 250,000 emigrants westward between 1843 and 1869. The spirit of the emigrants on my mind, I became eager to see the Rockies in their mighty glory. With sights set on the Pawnee National Grassland in Colorado I continued my journey due south.

Entering Colorado from a border on the plains is a mind-bender, especially when you see Colorado license plates flaunting the snow covered mountains. I couldn't help but hear Jim Carrey's voice from "Dumb and Dumber" questioning John Denver's integrity. The state of Colorado is cut in half by the Rockies, making the entire eastern portion of the state still part of the Great Plains - not generally how the great state of Colorado sells itself. However there are few things on the planet that compare with the first sighting of the Rockies headed westbound, suddenly seeing looming silhouettes of mountain peaks in the distance inspires that raw feeling of adventure.

But in October of 2020 the mountains had an eerie feeling that I had become all too familiar with in California, Oregon, and Washington earlier in the year. The smoke from the massive wildfires and a strong northerly wind created a cloud that covered the base of the mountains, but left the peaks towering above to create the illusion of floating mountains. Horrifying as the fires were, it was special to see such a phenomenon.

Pawnee National Grassland was out of the path of the smoke, leaving me alone in the wide open land as I camped for free in a dispersed camping area near the Pawnee Buttes Trailhead. The Pawnee Buttes are the crown jewel of the National Grassland, which boasts plenty of uninterrupted prairie lands and the beautiful Chalk Bluffs: a barren chalk escarpment that stretches from the South Platte River to the Wyoming border. Most visitors come to this desolate part of Colorado for the famous bird watching opportunities, which are so plentiful the National Audubon Society has recognized it as a site of "global importance". Of the raptors that nest in the area the most well known are: Swainson's hawks, golden eagles, and prairie falcons.

I spent three days and four nights on the grasslands enjoying the view of the mountains and the near constant prairie wind that provides a playground for the region’s famed birds of prey. These were the final days of my four month camping expedition around the northwest, and I wanted to soak up all the prairie had to offer. It would be a bitter return to civilization after falling in love with the plains upon my arrival in North Dakota at the beginning of the month. But as Edward Abbey said in 'Desert Solitaire':

"Balance, that's the secret. Moderate extremism. The best of both worlds. Unlike Thoreau who insisted on one world at a time I am attempting to make the best out of two."

U.S. Route 14, CO - Photo Credit: Scott Carnahan 

Toward the mountains, into the city, the Jeep destined to be parked in Denver as I return to the front lines of civilization to rebuild my bank account, develop my film, and prepare for the next journey into the wilds of America. 

Four months on the road through deserts, mountains, and finally the Great Plains; I was full of new wonder for the environmental diversity of the US. The patchwork of ecosystems is beautiful, and that includes the Midwest. Epic clouds floating in bright blue skies, awe inspiring sunsets against vast rolling prairies; the plains are home to a unique sense of adventure that longingly awaits.

Ancient Lakes and Rookie Mistakes
Lessons Learned on the Bonneville Salt Flats

Volcano Peak, UT - Photo Credit: Scott Carnahan 
 
Off Interstate 80 on the western edge of Utah lay the Bonneville Salt Flats, a vast swath of bright white land lined by towers and islands of brown rock. The layers of time all around the flats vary in shades of tan and brown, telling the story of the Great Basin. A drama epochs, ages, and eras in the making; that shaped the area centered in Nevada and reaching into the neighboring states of California, Oregon, Utah, and Idaho.  

The Great Basin was coined by John C. Fremont on an 1843 expedition upon which he recognized that the landform’s water drains internally. All precipitation in the area sinks underground, flows into lakes, or evaporates - there is no hydrological outlet to the ocean.

20,000 years ago the Salt Flats were Lake Bonneville, the ancestor to the Great Salt Lake we have today. Imagine if Lake Michigan spilled into the west, a massive lake full of many islands and peninsulas. Almost everywhere you look in Bonneville the lines of the ancient lake level are visible, all the way down to the flat white crust of beautiful salt.

On a hot August afternoon I felt that satisfying crunch under the wheels. Pulling out onto the salt bed, cotton candy thunderheads in the distance like huge jellyfish meandering through the sea. Just two gas powered crustaceans crawling along the bottom of the lake. A 1988 Ford campervan and a Nissan Xterra with a trailer - a sea slug and a crab. 

Our road weariness faded to an excited delirium. The caravan quickly embraced a world devoid of lines as we danced our vehicles out across the lake bed sprinkled with a seemingly magical coating of sodium. Like skateboarders in an abandoned pool we embraced freedom; charging into the unknown with your friends, golden clouds, and nothing but miles ahead. 

The van was the first to slip, making it clear our calculations were off. The caravan was headed directly for thick mud. Flooring the gas in an attempt to turn back the van quickly came to a sloppy stop. Attempts to reach the Xterra via walkie talkie were futile but it was no matter, they soon met the same demise. Stuck. Darkness was approaching as we sat immovable in a land completely devoid of life.

Assessing the certainty the mud would own us forever, angry at the land for reminding me of a treat I’d surely never have again. The tire was a cookie in a cup of frozen yogurt, the only thing missing from the situation, an actual cup o’ froyo. But this would now be our settlement, the people of the salt. A salt igloo neighborhood lined with ornate salt sculptures. Paradise at the bottom of the lake! Complete with local, free range, salt flavored froyo.

My compatriots didn’t share the same romanticism about the situation - the setting sun was cause for alarm. There is no camping allowed on the salt flats, and we were stuck miles away from the entry point or a legal campsite. No one agreed that I’d have a valid argument of being more in the salt flats than on them but…

Our ‘roadside’ insurance agent couldn’t hold back her laughter while citing the mile off the road policy. We didn’t have the right tools to dig ourselves out. It seemed a wild pack of sky sharks could come to consume us at any time. The terror subsided as a beer pow-wow led us to realize we had a brochure. On the back was the sheriff’s number - they too laughed at us before giving us the number of a specialty tow team, “Best in Wendover, UT.” 

In an hour, Wendover’s best would be arriving. I’d pictured a giant lobster coming to fix us up; or perhaps a team of sand crabs emerging from the dust; maybe an octopus who’s speed affords him time to also mix margaritas for his clients. Instead we got a snow cat operated by charming souls even saltier than the ground where they worked.

After we were given a lecture in mud disguised as salt science, we were asked for $5,000. Luckily they took a credit card. Once it was done, all three members of the tow team opened a beer and drove off, back to shore. 

It was decided by the caravan that we’d had enough of our sea legs. The sparkling horizon of West Wendover, NV was calling to us as the sunset faded to black. Free camping in the parking lot of a casino: Welcome to Nevada. 

Mud falling from our rigs, we emerged from the salt crusted wastes of Utah into the jingle jangle neon world of Nevada at night. We tailgated for dinner before trying to win back some recent losses; we tailgated after netting more losses, agreeing that the Nevada stars have an extra charm in the parking lot of a casino.

From Ice Age Lakes to $10.99 steaks, the Great Basin is loaded with adventure. Be sure to bring proper off-road recovery tools, along with ample water in case you do get stuck. A man at a bar in Reno once told me, “All you ever need is a ratchet strap and two by four to get out of the mud.” Turns out he’s right, google it, one of those great things life teaches you... after the fact. 

Plateaus, playas, and painted rock; to understand an environment is to learn the story of its development. From the viewpoint of geology the landscape is always in motion, let your imagination be filled by the history that is all around us…

Recent news updates going on in the world of the Outdoors that could impact your future travel plans. 
 Free Admissions Dates Offered at All National Parks 

All National Parks will be waiving their entrance fees on five days throughout the year. This has been a recent addition via Secretary Orders 3386 and 3387. The free entrance dates for the public are as follows: 
Saturday, April 17 – First day of National Park Week 
Sunday, August 4 – Anniversary of the Great American Outdoors Act 
Sunday, August 25 – National Park Service Anniversary 
Saturday, September 25 – National Public Lands Day 
Monday, November 11 – Veterans Day 
The same orders granted waived admission to 5th graders during the 2020-21 school year. All Veterans and Gold Star families have free admission for as long as these orders are valid as well. 

This would be a great time to check out Pathloom’s Top 5 National Parks To Visit In 2021! Prepare for high traffic and potential wait times, given these days have fees waived and most people are off work or out of school. 

Be sure to look up other National Parks you’re interested in visiting, because they may offer free admission days in addition to those offered by this program. For example, Shenandoah National Park celebrates Neighbor Appreciation Day on Saturday, June 19, by offering free admission to all visitors.

Rocky Mountain Reservations Shift To Online Only 

Beginning on March 1st, wilderness campsite reservations at Rocky Mountain National Park will only be open to booking online. The Wilderness Offices in the park announced they will not be accepting any in-person, phone, email or faxed reservations due to COVID-19 guidance. The link to book your campsite will go live at 8am MST on March 1st (the reservation system as a whole will not be available prior to that date and time). 

This is a much more convenient way to reserve campsites, compared to the former lottery system they had in place in years prior. Once you reach the magnificent Rocky Mountains, this will make it much more convenient to be able to head to your spot and get settled down before you start exploring. In some areas certain permits are needed, so be sure to research how to obtain a backcountry permit while planning out your trip. Have a look at more information on Rocky Mountain National Park and their camping guidelines before you book your online reservation and begin your journey!

Joshua Tree Offers Electronic Passes

Joshua Tree is another stop on Pathloom’s Top 5 National Parks to Visit in 2021. The annual attendance of Joshua Tree has almost tripled within the last five years, resulting in lengthy waiting periods for park entry. Park rangers have announced they now offer digital passes that can be purchased online in hopes of reducing the extended wait times for entry. As a friendly reminder: There is no cell service or wifi once you’re in the park. For this reason, try having your pass accessible on a digital wallet or printed out in advance (Maybe even both, just to be safe).

Tips for a Safer, Less Crowded Experience

In the early days of January, many public outdoors spaces have seen especially high activity from visitors. Park rangers have put together a list of reminders on best practices while visiting busy areas in their parks, and these apply just as well to any outdoors space. 
Stay on the trail. When venturing into the outdoors, it’s crucial to keep in mind that trails are present for a reason. They will help guide you to your ideal destination, and do so in the safest way possible. When walking off the designated paths, you’re risking yourself and the environment. There may be sensitive wildlife around that are best left undisturbed. 
Avoid peak times. Ending your day with a beautiful sunset can create a stunning panoramic image, but there have been high numbers of people checking out these views from the hours of 5-8pm. Some parks are open 24 hours, so there are certainly other times that you can get similar views, with less obstruction from others trying to do the same. This allows you to appreciate the beauty of nature and its experience while also following social distancing guidelines. 
Spread Out. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have learned that giving yourself plenty of space between others is one of the best things you can do to stay safe and healthy. This can be a great opportunity to check out some smaller, but still gorgeous trails in an effort to avoid large crowds. If you find crowds to be unavoidable, wear a mask and do your best to give yourself and others six feet of distancing wherever possible.

U.S Department of State Partners With National Park Service 

Environmental awareness is at an all time high. The National Park Service has recently connected with the U.S. State Department in order to honor and advocate for global environmental awareness. This partnership is driven by the desire to strengthen the Fulbright Program, a grant program that offers research, teaching, and study opportunities for international exchange students studying in the USA. This program operates in more than 140 countries, and supports finding solutions by exchanging domestic and international ideas regarding agriculture, arts, business and many more!

The intention behind this multi-organizational partnership is to “support and promote conservation of cultural and natural heritage across the globe”. The National Park Service will be giving Fulbright Program students the opportunity to gain professional experience in addition to their studies.

Los Padres National Forest Lifts Restrictions

About 1 hour’s drive from the Los Angeles metropolitan area, Los Padres National 
Forest has officially lifted fire restrictions placed in the wake of the Dolan Fire. The Dolan Fire originated around August 18, 2020 and is actively under investigation since it is alleged the fire was a result of arson. At this time, 124,924 burned acres remain closed while park rangers assess if there are additional measures needed for clearing. 

The park has, however, recently reopened surrounding roads and some trails, and now permits use of campfires and barbeques in all open areas of the park. (With great power comes great responsibility, and this extends to putting out your campfire too!) The park’s reopening comes after rain and snow swept through the area, which brought enough moisture to deplete fire hazards. The California coast has seen numerous major wildfires within the last year, including California’s oldest state park, Big Basin. Big Basin does not expect to reopen until next year at the earliest, as they recover from about 86,500 burned acres across Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties. 

The News about Los Padres comes in perfect timing as California, known for their strict COVID-19 restrictions, lifts stay at home orders. Not all campsites are back open at this time, but as the state begins to reopen more recreational areas it is crucial for visitors to recreate responsibly in order to keep one another safe. If you’re interested in visiting campgrounds around California, be sure to check individual campsites for more information about their restrictions and guidelines before making your plans.

Fires and Floating Trash
Smoke plume over Susanville, CA - Photo Credit: Scott Carnahan 

Northern California, August 2020.

Wildfire smoke was a daily part of life by now, and for 300 miles in every direction there was no escaping it. What a time to go camping.

Yet it wasn't just camping, I'd converted my Jeep into a camper and set out on an open ended quest. There was no choice but to endure the smoke as I hightailed it from Lake Tahoe up U.S. 395, past blackened land and into the small hamlet of Susanville, CA. Everything tinged with an orange hue, passing firefighters battling blazes on both sides of the highway. The town of 17,974 was in emergency mode from Wal-Mart to Main Street.

On all sides of the seat of Lassen County were wildfires, through clearings in the smoke you could see huge plumes rising from the forest. My goal of making it to Lassen Volcanic National Park began to feel foolhardy, but on I went. The landscape was reminiscent of the world if a volcano had just erupted. The blood red sky, the thick sea of smoke permeating the trees, the occasional fire truck watching for hot spots.

Searching the smoke map for a clean stretch of air, I found the U.S. 199 corridor: the gateway to the Redwood Empire. I changed my heading to the west, thankful that a low pressure system was hovering over the North Pacific, blowing in an offshore wind that kept the coastal mountains free from ash. It felt like the Coastal Redwoods in their organic mysticism were fighting off the evil noxious smoke. Windows down, sun dancing between the trees, the blue skies were a refreshing change. 

Coastal Redwoods take around 500 years to reach maturity. Many of these trees are over 1,500 years old, have diameters nearing 20 feet, and heights ranging up to 300 feet. They are typically better viewed outside of fire season, though the beauty was certainly still there. The Smith River running throughout the region is a national treasure - crisp, clear water flowing past pristine groves of ancient trees. Mountains descend to the Pacific's picturesque shores, the river a crystal vein connecting the forest to the sea.

I was lucky to find an idyllic river spot highlighted by a venerable rush of the river, bringing a calmness to the forest. A major contrast from the fire and brimstone I experienced in the Sierra Nevada Range and the San Joaquin Valley.

The Smith River was discovered during an 1823 expedition that was to be the foundation for the Oregon Trail. The river was named after Jedediah Strong Smith: a transcontinental pioneer, frontiersman, hunter, and cartographer. I found myself floating in the river; a perfect late summer temperature and pace, lost in day dreams of adventurers and mountain men roaming this unknown land long ago. Jed Smith and the explorers endured attacks by Native Americans, bears, and inclement weather - hardly a comparison to today's van-lifers and tourists, but the adventurous spirit continues on into these storied woods.

But I was soon disturbed by a plastic invader bumping into my head. A water bottle, the most avoidable of the plastic family, was making its way to the ocean via the Smith River. Luckily I grabbed it before it continued on, only to discover his reinforcements coming: a plastic chip bag and a meat snack wrapper that I jointly arrested and carried to shore to the trash. I was proud of my riverbound heroics until I saw it...

Several piles of human excrement, adorned with toilet paper. A horrifying break in camping etiquette, worsened by the surrounding bushes being haunted by an array of trash from multiple picnics.

"What would Jed Smith do?" I thought, the water on my body already drying in the drought-stricken forest, the wet trash in my hands begging to be put away. Upon finding such a mess there are two options: be a part of the problem, or do your part to solve the problem. Consider doing your part, like paying a tax for being in nature. Leaving No Trace is about paying it forward, so that others can experience the beauty of untouched nature.

Nothing compares to a bath in the river after a riverside cleanup. What ends up in the river makes its way to the sea, and every one of those items was bound for the North Pacific. Picking up extends beyond yourself - if you see it in nature it is up to you to take care of it. No matter where you go, leave it better than you found it.

By the next morning the wind had shifted, blowing from the southeast and driving the smoke north along the coast. Fires in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho kept the West covered in smoke for over a month. As I crossed each of those states, I was met with trash scattered from forest to coast, mountain to desert. It became a hobby, a daily challenge; to go out on trash walks in the smoke, picking up the beer cans and cigarette butts of many camping trips before. Make it a habit: anything that comes into nature with you comes back with you.

According to the FAS (Federation of American Scientists), 2020 brought 58,250 wildfires burning 10.27 million acres nationwide, topping the 2015 record - making 2020 the most impacted year since 1960. 40% of that blackened land was in California. An average of 88% of wildfires from 2015 to 2019 were sparked by humans, beating out lightning for the number one cause. 

Respecting nature and doing what is right is the only way to preserve the wilds for the future. It is important to remember that defending nature comes from the small moments, like picking up trash or putting your campfire out properly. 

Walking into the woods with a trash grabber and a bag is sexy! Accept that being passionate for the outdoors requires custodianship in the modern age. Last year showed us a future void of nature’s caretakers... 

Let 2020 be a call to action for us all.

The Medicinal Value of Camping Alone

Joshua Tree National Park, CA - Photo Credit: Scott Carnahan
 
The headlights died as I clicked the engine off. Leaning forward, confirming the darkness, a whole slurry of doubt came flooding into my mind. Alone? In the wilderness, that is absolutely crazy. My friends' responses now making sense: Why? How are you going to pass your time? What if something goes wrong? 

Why did this trip have to start at night? After driving four hours into the middle of the desert, I still found myself hesitant to get out of the car. The landscape I’d been so eager to be in was now a cold, dark mystery outside the safe little bubble that got me here. 

It was obvious, I’d gone too long without camping. The battle was lost, the last year made me a city boy. Setting up a tent in the dark sounded like an impossible task, as did cooking. But I reminded myself, You have no other choice. And I was right. That was the point, I had to survive by myself. Shelter, food, entertainment, back to the basics. With no cell phone service to procrastinate any further, I stepped outside. 

This past year I struggled a lot with personal and career drama. Life had become a sea of oysters without pearls. I’d lost hope in mankind, in myself. The only thing that made sense was to pull away from society completely and get lost in the desert for a while. 

Standing with my feet in the sand, gazing up at a sky of shimmering pearls sent a tear rolling down my cheek. In that moment I was reminded that the first breath you take in nature is the most healing.

When you are camping alone, there is so much to do. It is stressful at first. Normally someone is building the fire, somebody else is setting up the tents, and I’m meandering with a beer. But there weren’t any type A friends to let do the work, just myself, my looming hunger, and an everlasting sea of boulders and Joshua Trees.

Tent, food, fire. What came first? Perhaps a quick night hike would help me decide? No, it was late. But the stars looked so good! An owl hooted in the distance. A few deep breaths and it hit me… Screw the tent. Sleep in the car— on such a nice night, a hike and a trail mix/beer dinner is what I want. 

There’s no other agendas here, only my own. And I am in nature - glorious; animalistic; wild nature. Prep the pack, grab the headlamp, and step away from the vehicle… The only way to truly settle into the outdoors is to go on a night hike. There is no greater sense of solitude than stepping out into a dark void alone. 

That’s not to say I wasn’t peering over my shoulder at a constant clip. The imagination was on a fierce tear, sending all sorts of monsters darting between bushes behind me, cackling in the rocks, and plotting to beam me up for anatomical research. 
 Just me, myself, and the crunch of gravel under foot. You don’t always take a hike, the hike often takes you. I felt pulled into the night, something in the desert was essential to my journey so on I marched. 

Excitement, exploration, danger. I felt like a kid again, in the ultimate playground. It was a full on cleanse of all the stress, anxiety, and depression that life had smeared all over me. Dirt on my boots and crisp air in my lungs. Not a helicopter, siren, or sound of rubber bouncing over a manhole. I was back in the promised land. 

Solitude brings gratitude, or so I thought, standing atop a massive rock pile, watching a bright orange moon rise over the mountain to the east. I nearly spit out my beer when I first saw the flash of color over the ridge, certain this would be the moment I’d be abducted.
 Instead, I found myself in an eternal moment. The kind you don’t forget, the kind that is yours and yours alone. The diamond in the rough when you’ve been lost, making you realize all along that the steps you took were right, because they brought you here. This like every moment before, you are exactly where you need to be. 

Yes, beautiful things lay waiting in the desert at night. The coyotes seemed to agree, as they howled out in a grandiose chorus… Likely springing a trap on unsuspecting prey, but I preferred to imagine them singing for me. Cheering me on in this desert homecoming, naturally insisting that it was time for another beer.

...Like a baked potato I awoke in my car, harshly reminded of the desert's bipolar temperatures. Dehydrated in the night, the trail mix a poor excuse for a dinner. A dry mouth and a hangover, the night’s majesty ripped away in the blink of an eye by the harsh reality of the sun. 

This is where the rubber meets the road in the solo camping experience. Like a zombie I rose to search for water, which was the first step in a long line of monumental tasks to become a viable person again. It is through such occasions that one can find a new way of living, when laziness has no place and organizing the brain is akin to advanced calculus. 

A valuable lesson was learned: always set up your camp before having fun. Waking up in a hot tent has the easy remedy of an open flap. A belly full of a quality dinner makes for a zen morning, and drinking water with your beer in the desert ensures a steady rise. 

The hot sun spared no mercy as I worked, fighting distraction and hangover alike. It was breakfast, the pit toilet, setting up my tent and shade structure all before being able to relax. Such a valuable experience in the riches of being prepared and no one to blame but myself.

Finally, with a cool iced tea in the shade, I pondered the subtle process of camping. The beauty that solitude in the wilds brings isn’t just in the moments you share with nature—it is the process that we as humans must take to be in nature. 

In our normal lives, we control the temperature, the lighting, the music. When we are in the outdoors we relinquish our control, leaving our basic needs as the only thing to worry about.  
 Building shelter, providing sustenance, and recreating alone is a process constantly in motion. Solitude is about finding peace in the process, reconnecting to nature through work -  because the essence of any ecosystem is work. 

A jackrabbit bounds past my camp, a prairie falcon circles overhead. Two desert residents, working away as they have for centuries. Just witnessing the dance of nature is to participate in it. Sitting quietly, listening to the wind and its birds flirting from branch to branch. The creak of the Joshua Tree stretching to the sun. The scamper of a proud lizard, the far off rattle of a flying grasshopper. A world that you can only be a part of in desolation. 

For an animal, there is no other reason for living except to live. To eat, to sleep, to procreate. It is incredibly simple. For humans it could be the same, yet we’ve made our basic needs for survival far more complicated. We get wrapped up in/with so many details that it becomes easy to forget the simplicity of life. Finding connection with moments of stillness is a powerful way to recharge the soul. 


Each day after the hangover, life got much easier. Facing the elements alone builds character- to handle loneliness, boredom, and fear forces you to face yourself. Like seeing your soul in the mirror you become aware of what aspects can be improved on, or cut back. In other words: It allows you to mold yourself into who you want to be. 

Just as the process of camping alone is always in motion, so too is the process of self improvement. What I learned from my desert sojourn became a groundwork for my personal development. It inspired me to set my mental health as a priority, as well as embrace my need for adventure. 
 That voyage to Joshua Tree was the gateway drug to a whole new reality. Solo travel into the wilderness has become a staple of my life, and has furthered my own personal evolution while intentionally getting lost in America’s most beautiful landscapes. 

There is a whole world out there to explore, and infinite depth inside yourself to harness. So grab your pack, headlamp, and step away from the vehicle.

Don’t be scared, it is all part of the program.

Have you ever heard the phrase “work smarter, not harder”? Keep that in mind when you have an urge to splurge on expensive equipment.

Building a versatile outdoor gear collection can become pretty pricey. However with the proper preparation, your purchases can hold a much greater value to you and your adventures. There are many different ways to spend your time in nature, spanning from a casual hike using all the things you already own to an extraordinary backpacking trip into unchartered territory. 

It’s important to acknowledge that everyone has different needs, especially in their preference of tents, hammocks, camping chairs, etc. Allow this guide to act as advice for when to invest in top-quality gear or when you should save some cash. With that being said, let’s dive into my tried-and-true 5 foolproof filters to strategic shopping.

How often do you plan on using this?

Let’s be realistic here, a great place to start is thinking of your necessities. The pro-tip here would be to think of the versatility of an item when deciding on an investment. A great buy would be a first aid kit equipped with all the antiseptic sprays, dressings and Band-Aids. This holds such a high value since it quite literally revolves around your well-being. One thing I personally love to look for in a first aid kit is a compact package, to take up as little room in your pack as possible. I also find it helpful to have refills handy to customize the kit to your needs.

An example of an item that may not be as valuable to purchase would be something like a paddleboard for your first trip near a lake. While I absolutely understand the satisfaction of buying as opposed to renting, this might be a great time to try the latter unless you plan on paddling around your pool at home. This leads us to the second filter...


Is there a rental option available?

In some cases, renting is not only more budget-friendly, but it is also a great opportunity for trial and error. Let’s say you rent a sleeping pad on a camping trip to use underneath your sleeping bag. The pad you have rented is less than ideal and deflates quickly. This would have been an easy item to purchase outright, but now that you have experience with it you can use it as a reference when buying your own. Maybe you also learned through this experience that you also prefer a flat sleeping pad instead of one with ridges. Renting allows you to narrow down what features are non-negotiable for you when you eventually are prepared to purchase.

A great place to check out rentals is your local REI. Their available gear may vary by store, but this is a great option since there are many locations throughout the US.

What’s the lifespan of this product?

When getting ready to purchase a big item, it can be helpful to consider how long it will serve its purpose. My parents bought a Coleman tent about 20 years ago when they started taking us on annual camping trips with their friends. That tent is the same one we haul along to this day and set up in between everyone else’s upgraded trailers and toy haulers. Needless to say, that was an investment that positively played out over several years (now decades!)

The best way to determine the lifespan of any item is to hear it from those who have already invested their money, time and experience in it. In order to utilize reviews to your advantage, I’d suggest checking to see what the reviewer specifically used the item for, and where they feel like the faults are. If you find it to be a consistent issue in all reviews, or the issue is one of your non-negotiables, this may be a sign that the item won’t serve you best. With that in mind...


What do the reviews say?

Reviews are your best friend when researching your next potential purchase. I love to check out OutdoorGearLab when looking into gear purchases, since they offer individual reviews and product comparisons. Since reviews come from customers as opposed to the manufacturers, this will allow you to get an unbiased understanding of the practicality and reliability of items. This will be especially valuable for novice outdoor enthusiasts. You can learn a lot about the functions and situations different products are used for from people who have first-hand experience in those situations. There have been times that reading reviews has held the power to make or break a purchase, so be sure to recognize the benefit of well researched shopping.

Reach out to your local community!

In case you were wondering, there is a Facebook group for just about everything  - including dozens for local outdoors lovers. Pathloom has a group set up for this specific reason as well! By joining groups such as these, you will be able to hear from people who may have previously taken the same trails as you hope to. They will likely be happy to share tips and tricks from their personal experience that can help you, too! You can see their recommendations, and also connect with a new community of people with similar interests! 

One of my favorite things about Pathloom is that we strive for this kind of connection. By signing up for early access, you’ll receive a list of some of our favorite dispersed campsites, and all our social media information conveniently located on one page to help you make these connections with the rest of our community. 


Don’t forget that sometimes less is more. 

I’ll admit, I love a good Pinterest packing list, with everything you need for every occasion. However, many of these encourage you to pack more than is actually necessary. As an example, there have been a few times I have utilized a list emphasizing dry shampoo as a necessary toiletry. But by packing a product I don’t have much use for, I end up spending more time digging around the item in my pack than actually using it. In addition, I am guilty of forgetting sunscreen on my camping trips. This is the perfect example of where I could have ditched the dry shampoo for something much more important and useful. 

Consider what is required for you to bring on your trip, versus what is more of a luxury. This is another instance that truly emphasizes how everyone has different needs. A great packing list to reference would be this one from REI that breaks down necessities, but also includes optional item ideas. In addition to considering personal necessities, one must also keep what's best for the natural environment in mind when packing for a trip. Flexibility, and responsibility, according to your own personal needs is the key.


Outdoor adventures create memories that last a lifetime, and the gear you purchase and bring along can either enhance or inhibit the experience. I have found these filters to have helped me in numerous situations, so I hope this serves the same purpose for you!

Pathloom Picks: Best Campsites of 2020
Our Staff picks some of our favorite campsites visited this year

Happy Holidays from the Pathloom family! 2020 hasn’t been easy for anyone, but here’s to us all for making the most out of the toughest of situations! For us, and for many of you, our escape from this year’s sheer insanity involved getting out into the middle of nowhere, pitching a tent, and soaking up every last drop of nature we could possibly take in. 

We’d like to share with you some of the Pathloom staff’s favorite sites we camped at in 2020. However, we thought we’d switch it up a bit from the traditional list and give you our favorite sites for each time of day. Do you love a good sunrise? Check out our “Morning” picks. Prefer to stay up late and see a night sky filled with stars? We’ve got you covered there too, scroll down to the “Night” section! Whatever makes the particularly perfect campsite for you, we’ve got you covered!

Please bear in mind that the majority of our staff was based on the US West Coast this year, and thanks to the pandemic we weren’t able to travel all that far. So our apologies if this list is a bit western-US-oriented! If you’ve got some recommendations (and pictures!) for your favorite campsites in other parts of the country, we’d love to hear about them! Send an email to blog@pathloom.com , or click here to check out our story submission guidelines! 


Without further ado, here are Pathloom’s Picks for our favorite campsites of 2020! 
 Grand Teton National Park, WY - Photo Credit: Sierra Jones

Best for the Morning: 
 Silver Fork American River (backcountry site), Kyburz CA: “Riverside camping surrounded by tall pines and firs, waking up to the sound of the flowing river. Great for water activities and swimming!”

Finnon Lake Campground, Placerville CA: “The best morning I had camping this year was at Finnon Lake in Placerville. There’s nothing better than seeing a brilliant sunrise reflecting off the surface of the water as you jump in for a morning swim. Throw in a bald eagle swooping low across the lake, fishing for breakfast about a hundred feet away, just for good measure.“

Leigh Lake (backcountry site), Grand Teton National Park, WY: “The best views of the Teton Range, and we were able to witness the ’smoky’ lake effect with the morning evaporation. Also a great spot to jump into the lake for a morning dip!”

 Cave Springs Campground: Sedona, AZ - Photo Credit: Bryan Donoghue

Best for Mid-day: 
 Memorial Park Campground, Big Sur, CA: “Great hiking access to Cone Peak and other smaller trails nearby. Tons of swimming holes to relax by during the day.” 

Cave Springs Campground, Sedona AZ: “Plenty of tree cover to stop that Arizona sun from frying you to a crisp, plus the site is less than a mile walk from the West Fork trailhead - often considered to be one of the most beautiful trails in the country.”

Jenny Lake Campground, Grand Teton National Park, WY: “A great place to base yourself in the park. It’s a small, secluded campground in the forest, with easy access to lots of trails to explore around the lake.”

 Bryce Canyon National Park, UT - Photo Credit: Bryan Donoghue

Best for the Evening:
 Death Valley National Park (backcountry site), CA: “Spectacular sunsets over the wide valley, with 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains. The night sky made for an epic meteor shower viewing!”

Sunset Campground, Bryce Canyon National Park, UT: “The sunset splashing pastel shades across the hoodoos, goblins, and other unique rock structures that make up the Amphitheater was without a doubt the most alien thing I have ever seen on the planet.”

Chesler Park (backcountry site), Canyonlands National Park, UT: “Lots of slot canyons and trails to explore. The way the sunset reflects off of the desert rocks is unbelievable! 

 Gregory Creek, Shasta Lake, CA - Photo Credit: Bryan Donoghue

Best for the Night:
 Panther Meadows Campground, McCloud CA: “The highest elevation campground on Mount Shasta. The views are amazing, and the night sky opens up like no other! Sitting by a campfire at 7,500 feet, roasting marshmallows, and just letting the night sky take you over.” 

Gregory Creek (backcountry site), Shasta Lake CA: “Hours away from anything resembling a major city, the utter lack of light pollution and sparse tree cover lakeside gave us a 360 degree view of an impossibly bright starscape.” 

Chesler Park (backcountry site), Canyonlands National Park UT: “Chesler again! Canyonlands is a Dark Sky park, so be sure to check out the stars at night!”



Happy holidays everyone! Stay safe and healthy so we can see you at one of these campsites sometime soon!

The Glory of Yosemite
Wild Inspiration For The Masses

Everything about Yosemite is fascinating. 750,000 acres of land, 800 miles of trails, countless mountains and cliffs ringing the valley, dozens of waterfalls, rivers, and lakes peppered throughout - all with their own unique stories to tell. 

A trip to Yosemite National Park does not satiate, it only stokes an increased desire to discover its hidden secrets, to see for oneself all this vast wilderness has to offer. Unrivaled in beauty, unparalleled in majesty, Yosemite has developed a mystique unmatched by other National Parks that are otherwise as highly regarded. Yosemite is like the most addictive of drugs, a mere taste leaves you desperate to go back to experience more, to learn all there is to know about such a magical place in preparation for the next opportunity to dive back in. 

Yosemite has long been a source of inspiration for all who experience its splendor. It inspired John Muir to lobby government agencies to protect the pristine beauty of wilderness areas across the country. It inspired Teddy Roosevelt to camp with Muir for three days in Mariposa Grove, a trip that would shape his conservationist agenda and lay the foundation to ensure the preservation of the National Parks and Forests that we continue to enjoy today.

Some of the greatest American artists have been both directly and indirectly inspired by Yosemite. Ansel Adams’ most famous photography captures the valley at its finest. Before him, the nature photography of Carleton Watkins helped inspire Abraham Lincoln to enact the Yosemite Grant, to ensure this beautiful forest would be preserved for public use - even as the Civil War raged on. Watkins was often accompanied by famed landscape artist Thomas Hill, who brought to life on canvas images of the park that grace the halls of the US Capitol building to this very day. Today, Yosemite Renaissance sponsors a robust Artists In Residence program to ensure the park’s natural beauty will continue to be painted by some of the best and brightest of the modern art community.

The bounty of Yosemite has inspired physical feats in addition to artistic. The climbing exploits of legends like Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold have been well-documented in film. In Honnold’s case, one could argue a bit of insanity may have been mixed in with inspiration, as his ‘Free Solo’ climb was done with no ropes, harnesses, or any sort of equipment to save him from falling thousands of feet to his death should he have made a single misstep. Honnold’s climbing inspired a film crew to document his conquering of the infamous El Capitan, which won an Oscar for Best Documentary in 2019.

Unfortunately, Yosemite’s proclivity to inspire physical feats can result in tragedy as well. In 2015, world renown BASE jumpers Dean Potter and Graham Hunt met with calamity after a jump from Taft Point into the valley went horribly wrong. Of the thousands of hikers who make the ascent up Half Dome on an annual basis, not all of them make the return. Accidents while climbing, hiking, and scrambling off-trail result in hundreds of Search &amp; Rescue operations within the park each year. With great inspiration often comes great danger - and regardless of the amount of training or preparation, Yosemite does not discriminate. The simplest of mistakes can result in unmitigated disaster if one is not sufficiently careful. 

In some cases, the aforementioned mystique of Yosemite has been known to inspire stories of the occult as well. The cold, evil wind gusting around Po-ho-no (known today as Bridalveil Falls) has long been rumored to send unwary travelers plummeting to their doom. Grouse Lake, high in the mountains, is known for the sound of a crying boy, beckoning hikers to enter the lake so they can be dragged down into the depths below. Even the Ahwahnee Hotel, located on the Valley floor, has been said to be haunted for decades. Perhaps less occult, but equally chilling - the interior of the Ahwahnee inspired much of the set design for Stanley Kubrick’s horror classic “The Shining”.

Over four million visitors come to Yosemite every year - some to find inspiration, some to find some sort of gratification, some just to find picturesque vistas for selfies. Regardless of motivation, all have the conservationists and pioneers of the past to thank for Yosemite continuing to be the Mecca for outdoor enthusiasts that it is today. A more fertile ground for the imagination is difficult to find anywhere on the planet - how one chooses to bring that imagination to life is entirely up to the individual. Throughout every season, around every bend of every trail, on top of every cliffside and spanning every waterfall - Yosemite is majesty incarnate, and must be witnessed firsthand to truly begin to comprehend. 


“Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul alike.” 
- John Muir

In case you haven’t seen it on our social media channels, (and if not, make sure you're following Pathloom on Facebook and Instagram!), Pathloom is giving away a free tent to one lucky winner at the end of this month! 
After careful consideration, we’ve elected to offer the ALPS Mountaineering 2-person Zephyr Tent in this giveaway because we think it’s one of the best on the market for both car camping and short backpacking trips. Our founder, Ankit, has been using this for years due to it’s versatility and durability - and the fact that it only weighs about 5 pounds in the pack! 
In addition to being extremely lightweight, we also love how quickly and easily this tent can be pitched, as well as its high marks for water resistance - perfect if you need to get your campsite set up on short notice! There is plenty of room in the vestibules under the rain fly to keep your gear dry without crowding your sleeping area too much - and if you’re planning on sharing the tent with a fellow camper (or furry friend), the two separate doors are unbelievably useful to avoid disturbing your companion at night.

Cold Weather Camping &amp; Hiking
Tips and Tricks from the Pathloom Team

It’s starting to get cold out! Recent studies have shown nearly 30% more Americans turned to nature for their recreation needs under the shadow of 2020’s Covid pandemic than they did in 2019. But as the temperatures dwindle, so too does the appeal of camping and hiking for many people. This rings especially true for those of us living in colder climates where snow, rain, sleet, hail, and other forms of nightmarish precipitation rain down from the heavens with increasing frequency. 

Sure, a blisteringly frosty windblast to the face when you first step outside to get the mail in the morning may not provide much encouragement to load up the car and head to the hills for a camping trip. Slipping on a patch of early-onset black ice on the sidewalk while walking your dog might not convince you to hit the trails for a long hike in the woods. Spending an hour before work scraping and shoveling the ice off of your windshield and the snow off your car may not fill you with the urge to hop in said car and drive out to the beach for a run amongst the wind-swept dunes.

But camping and hiking during the late fall and winter has so much to offer! There are few experiences in this world as exhilarating as waking up to an alien landscape blanketed in snow. The sunlight glittering off a pine tree with each and every needle encased in ice. The patterns formed by a babbling brook frozen over. The peaceful solitude you experience out on the trails by yourself, the muffled silence of the air around you - popular places that would be bustling with crowds during the summer grow eerily quiet and all the more fascinating in the wintertime when you have the entire area to yourself. 

The key to enjoying the outdoors during the cold weather months is, as with so many other things, proper preparation. Planning wisely for the weather - and equipping yourself with the right gear - is certainly important at any time of year, but it is never more crucial than during the winter months.

So we thought we’d share a few tips and tricks from the Pathloom team that may help keep you safe and warm and able to enjoy all the undeniable allure that nature in wintertime has to offer. Our staff features former Park Rangers and Search &amp; Rescue personnel, so these are some of the most useful items they’ve come across over their time in the field. Bundle up and enjoy the weather!

 Hiking Tips
 “Share your plan! Make sure friends and family know where you’re going, and how long you plan to be gone for, so in case of emergency there are others who will have a general idea regarding your whereabouts.” (A)
“Check in with the local ranger to ensure there aren’t any weather-related issues with your planned hiking route (e.g. trail closures, fallen trees, washed-out trails etc). They may also have up-to-date information about any storms threatening the area.” (B)
“Many National Parks close up their visitor centers and campgrounds during winter, so its important to get as much information as you can before you head out on your journey.” (S)
“Don’t sweat! Sweat can freeze on you and cause hypothermia. Consider less strenuous physical activities when out in the cold, take more breaks, drink more water, and if possible, wear synthetic or woolen materials that won’t cause you to sweat as quickly or easily as cotton will.” (P)
“Wearing layers you can add/remove as needed will also help you avoid sweating.” (J)
“Warm socks and gloves! Cotton just won’t do the trick, and you run into that same danger of sweating. We recommend merino wool socks - they may seem expensive but you’ll never regret owning a pair - and they last forever if you take care of them!” (B)
“Bring a flashlight, even if you’re hiking during the daytime. It gets dark quick in the mountains during the wintertime! Be sure to bring extra batteries, too!” (J)

 Camping Tips
 “Avoid making camp near lakes, rivers, or other bodies of water. The moisture in the air can cause icing on your clothes and/or tent.” (A)
“Be ready to conjure up some heat quickly upon arrival to your campsite. Have the right tools ready to build your fire fast - you might not normally need some firestarters or a torch to build your campfires when you go out during the summer, but they sure help speed up the process when you’re freezing your butt off after hiking to your site!” (B)
“Don't try and build a fire under a tree. Steer clear of any low-hanging branches - as the heat rises from the fire the snow on those branches will melt, fall, and can douse/smother what you’ve worked so hard to build.” (J)
“Bring a camping stove! Bring an extra canister of fuel too, just in case.” (P)
“Bring cocoa, or decaf coffee/tea. If it’s late and you want something hot to drink, you don’t necessarily want to be up all night. Plus, you’ll want to save that caffeinated coffee for the morning!” (B)
“Clear the snow out from under your tent before it has a chance to freeze! If this isn’t possible, tamp down the snow in the area as much as possible to build insulation and prevent it melting while you sleep, which can have drastic effects on your body temperature.” (B)
“Invest in a cold weather sleeping bag - make sure it’s graded for the temperature you’ll be staying in, and make sure you don’t confuse Fahrenheit and Celsius (like I swear I absolutely didn’t do that one time).” (B)
“Invest in a sleeping bag liner - they are usually super lightweight and can add 10-15 degrees of extra warmth!” (S)
“Bring extra layers of insulation for the ground - an inflatable mat with a good R rating is vital to ensure you have enough padding between you and the icy ground to avoid losing body heat while you sleep!” (A)
“For extra warmth, put some hot water in a water bottle and stick it near your feet in your sleeping bag.” (S)

Make sure to keep CampDog nice and toasty too!

Cabin Fever - The Only Prescription is More Camping!
Camping in Sedona after too much time away from the tent

Needless to say, the wildfires that have swept California in 2020 have caused much greater harm than preventing some guy from going camping. Indeed, we’ve written about this in the past. Our hearts certainly go out to every person, community, tree, and animal impacted by such a horrible turn of events. 

But for me personally, living in the heart of San Francisco, cabin fever hit me like a truck once I could no longer get out of the city for my usual camping, hiking, and other outdoor adventures. In the early part of the summer I was doing all I could to go camping in as many regions of California as possible once the pandemic shut down my usual bar, restaurant, and live music venues that make living in a major city so desirable for me. Once it struck me that camping was the ideal activity for social distancing - each person on the trip brings their own ride, their own kit, their own food/beer, and kept a big ol’ fire between them to ensure they stayed 6+ feet apart - I was out in nature just about each and every week. It was my way to stay sane while the world as we knew it crumbled around us.

Then the whole state caught fire. That put a stop to my camping adventures pretty damn abruptly.

Between the active wildfires throughout California and the entire western portion of the country, and the resulting smoke blanketing the region that made it so difficult to breathe while outside, outdoor activities in the area were now out as well, cast off onto the Covid pile with the concerts and the travel plans and such. Even beta testing our Pathloom app was getting a little depressing - discovering all of these amazing hikes and camping areas that were so close, but still entirely inaccessible due to hazardous conditions choking the area.

(No, I’m not looking for your sympathy. Yes, I realize we all have our own version of these frustrations. Give me a break here, I’m setting up a story. Do you want to tell yours? Then reach out to me at bryan@pathloom.com and let’s talk about getting you a guest blogging spot here on Pathloom!)

For the next two months I watched my friends back on the East Coast take advantage of the remnants of the Summer and early Fall - mountain biking in the White Mountains, hiking in the Smokies, beach camping on the Atlantic shoreline. As outwardly gracious as I tried to be, on the inside I was seething with jealousy. Not only were they having these incredible adventures while I was stuck indoors staring at the ever-increasing AQI figures, it was during what might be the most beautiful season of the year to do so (in the Northeast anyway). Cool Autumnal breezes cutting through the thick sweltering humidity of the summer proffered ideal temperatures to sleep in a tent - with a backdrop of leaves turning vibrant with reds, oranges, and yellows. I don’t miss much about the weather in the Northeast since moving out West, but I have yet to find anything out here that can hold a candle to Fall in New England.

I had to make something happen, get away from the city, away from the smoke and the fire, back to the outdoors. I’d have to figure things out on the fly, but I couldn’t stay in town for a moment longer. I had an opportunity arise to stay in Phoenix, AZ for a week (I wrote a bit about that trip here), and I jumped on it. I had never explored much of the Southwest before, the area wasn’t entirely on fire, and there were about a thousand camping spots in that part of the country on my bucket list that I was dying to explore - this was my chance to start checking some of them off! 

My week in Phoenix gave me ample time to do some research, and I determined that my first stop for camping on this trip would be the beautiful mountains of Sedona, Arizona. A friend of mine came down from Las Vegas to link up with me, and we met up about halfway down Route 89A between Sedona and Flagstaff at Cave Springs campground. 

FYI that stretch of route 89A might also be in the running for best driving roads in the country - between the jagged red rock cliffs and the lush green forest, the contrast presented a stunning view around each and every hairpin turn. While I loved driving down that road, nothing made me happier than arriving at the site, setting up my tent, and realizing I had finally gotten out of that depressing cycle of Covid city life and back into nature! A few nights under the (incredible!) stars in Sedona were just what I needed to realign myself.

We made the most of our trip, even though we barely had enough time to scratch the surface of all that Sedona had to offer. An easy late afternoon hike around the Secret Slick Rock area on our first day was an excellent start - that magnificent Arizona sunset splashing across jagged red hills covered in verdant forests was an excellent backdrop to a panoramic view of Cathedral Rock and the area’s other striated buttes exploding up from the trees. This was an incredibly easy hike (our CampDog’s little legs were certainly grateful for that!), that led to an area thick with trails and cliffs to explore while out there - highly recommended for any level of hiker to get a taste of the Sedona experience. 

West Fork Trail: Sedona, AZ - Photo Credit: Bryan Donoghue

Our Day 2 hike was another easy one, though well worth the (lack of) effort. Our campsite was about a mile up the road from West Fork Trail, which is regarded as one of the top 10 best hiking trails in the US. If we’re that close to something that’s supposed to be that good we kind of have to do it, right? Absolutely no regrets. 

This relaxing, lazy hike that cut back and forth across Oak Creek lived up to its billing - food for the soul for humans and CampDog alike. The trail winded throughout the watershed amidst a serene forest, shadowed by brilliantly colored steep cliffs. The babbling water was crystal clear, inviting and invigorating - though judging from CampDog’s expression maybe a bit too cold for the amount of wading he had to do with those little legs. He's tougher than he looks, but not that much tougher. The initial trail ends at a wide and somewhat deep pool surrounded by more red rock cliffs - there are another 11 miles of backpacking trails beyond the pool, but we were not well enough equipped for that trek at the time - we’ll just have to make it happen next time! (For the record, though we were sad to have to turn back, a sodden bedraggled CampDog couldn’t possibly have been happier with our decision.)

If for some sick, twisted, deranged reason Sedona doesn’t have enough to feed your hunger for the outdoors, yet another amazing aspect of the area is its proximity to the regal and imposing mountains of Flagstaff, about 40 miles to the north. Though we could have stayed another month in Sedona without achieving half of what we would have liked to do, we had a schedule to keep, so we packed up camp the next day and set off to meet a local friend for a day hike en route to our next destination. 

Inner Basin Trail: Flagstaff, AZ - Photo Credit: Bryan Donoghue

Remember how I mentioned that nothing out West could hold a candle to New England in the Fall? The Inner Basin Trail winding through the San Francisco Peaks might just be up to that challenge. The path up the mountain switched back through an endless glade of Aspen trees, golden Fall foliage as far as the eye could see. The stark contrast of the yellow leaves on branches and strewn on the ground made the grey bark of the trees look an eerie shade of blue. The trail itself was well-traveled, but wide enough to allow parties to pass by each other unimpeded. The number of people on the trail was somewhat surprising, considering we had to hop in our friend’s truck to navigate the treacherous cliffside dirt road that led up to the trailhead at Lockett Meadow - no way was my little sedan going to make that trip. 

I still can’t believe that 9000 foot mountains out here don’t get their own name. 

And no, the irony is not lost on me that I had put well over 1000 miles on the car just to end up back in a place called San Francisco.

Flagstaff is thousands of feet up in the mountains, and thus has an entirely different climate than the other parts of the state that makes it easy to forget you’re still in Arizona - until the sun sets. I still can’t get over these Arizona sunsets, right up there with the most beautiful I’ve seen in all my travels. After our hike came to an end, as our truck carved down the dirt road back toward civilization, the sky painted itself with pinks, blues, and yellows, looking like a cotton candy machine gone haywire. Of course my phone was long dead at this point, preventing me from capturing such a beautiful image with anything other than my mind’s eye. No worries, I will definitely be coming back to this state as soon as possible, to absorb as many more of these sunsets as I possibly can. But for now, my time in Arizona has come to an end - Utah awaits!

All About Bears
A Bear Safety Guide

 
As discussed in past articles, there are dozens of steps to take to prepare for an outdoors trip, depending on the type of recreation and the region you’ll be recreating in. While each individual aspect of the planning process is important in its own right, it is absolutely crucial to consider the wildlife found in the area, and the impact their presence may have on you (and vice versa!)

This series of articles will be highlighting proper preparation and safety techniques for all sorts of wildlife, but let’s start with the biggest and baddest of the bunch, the bear (with apologies to our Moose friends). Different species of bears can be found throughout the entire country, so it’s important to know what to bring with you, how to avoid encounters while in their territory, and to know what to do in the event you come into contact with them.

Bear Safety Gear
 Bear Canisters - also known as Bear Resistant Food Containers, or BRFC’s. A good bear canister allows you to store all of your smelly items in such a way that the smell won’t attract any unwanted attention - no need to string up your bags if you’ve got one of these. Keep it far away from your tent to minimize the risk of a bear rummaging through your campsite while you’re sleeping. Use these for food, trash, hygiene products, and any other scent-emitting items - including the clothes you cooked in! -but remember to test it out before your trip to ensure everything fits inside! Also, make sure you are using an approved bear-resistant product!
For a smaller size/weight profile in your backpacking kit, you can also utilize airtight Loksak bags, though you’ll want to check to be sure these are approved for use in your destination.
Ursacks are an excellent alternative to bear canisters as well - they are made out of extremely strong material and can deter a bear from accessing your food.

Bear Spray / Bear Mace - The most effective non-lethal bear deterrent, bear spray is used as a last resort to ward off charging bears and discourage them from attacking you. Make sure to check the regulations of whatever park you’re visiting - some prohibit the use/possession of bear spray altogether. Here’s a great video by the National Parks Service on how to use bear spray effectively. Our friends over at Atlantic Survival Gear did an extremely comprehensive breakdown of how bear spray works, check it out here! Proper usage of bear spray can buy you just enough time to make your escape (by walking, not running!)

Rope - considering you may need to hang multiple bags of food, trash, etc. from trees to keep them away from bears, you’re going to need a lot of rope. Nylon or paracord is probably your best bet, for strength and lack of weight.

Bear Avoidance Techniques
 Read the signs! Many parks will label certain areas as “bear management areas” and restrict/prohibit visitor access. This is for your own safety! 

Get Loud! Bears are at their most dangerous when surprised, so it’s important to announce your presence on a regular basis (especially when hiking solo) by yelling out, or even singing while on the trail! Call out “yo bear!” when going around blind corners on the trail, just in case. Also, the more people in your group, the better. 
If a bear approaches your campsite, make as much noise as you can to discourage it from paying you a visit. 
Playing music at your campsite (at reasonable volumes!) is another good way to discourage bears from visiting.

Food - Keep your food safe when camping in bear territory. If you’re using a developed site and there is a bear box - use it - it’s there for a reason. If you’re dispersed camping, or at a site with no box, string your food up from a tree branch 100+ yards from your tent - at least 10 feet off the ground and 4 feet from the tree trunk. Do the same with your trash, cosmetics, lotions, toothpaste, and anything else that might give off bear-attracting aromas. Even the clothing you cooked your dinner in can retain enough scent to cause a problem! 
If you’re car camping, the inside of a locked car makes for an excellent bear box as well.
Also remember not to leave any bags with food unattended, even for a minute! 

Cook, clean, and go to the bathroom a safe distance away and downwind from your tent.

Keep crumb clean - dispose of any food scraps that may have fallen onto the ground while cooking/eating.

Carcasses. Bears like to eat dead things too - especially hoofed mammals. If you find an animal carcass on or around the trail you’re on, there’s a good chance that a bear is on it’s way (or may already be there!) Turn around and go back the way you came, immediately. As always, walk-don’t-run.

Watch for poop… or tracks… or large holes dug in the ground. If you spot any fresh evidence of a bear in the area, it’s best to get yourself out of that area as quickly as possible - back the way you came, as if you haven’t encountered them yet the bear(s) are presumably up ahead of you. 

Bear cubs may be adorable, but they are almost certain to be accompanied by an extremely protective mother bear. There is almost no worse place to be on the planet to be than between a mother and her cub, so back away as far and as quickly (but don't run!) as possible.

If you do see a bear, do everything you can to stay 100+ yards away from it. Any closer than that and the bear may consider you a threat, which could lead to...

Bear Attack! 
 It’s very rare that a bear will attack a human unprovoked. Proper preparation and avoidance techniques reduces this chance to near-zero. But it’s important to recognize that near-zero is not actual-zero, so you should know what to do in this worst-case scenario. 

According to the rangers at Yellowstone, “If the bear clacks its teeth, sticks out its lips, huffs, woofs, or slaps the ground with its paws, it is warning you that you are too close and are making it nervous.” Time to back away and try to remove yourself from the situation before it’s too late. 

First and foremost, never run. Bears are faster than you are, and will instinctually chase after you if you try to escape. Don’t try to climb a tree either, as black bears tend to be better climbers as well. Stand your ground, counterintuitive as that may seem.

Second - have your bear spray handy, and make sure you’ve practiced how to remove the safety and fire prior to your life depending on it! 

Do not spray if the bear doesn’t charge - even if it rears up on its hind legs that’s typically more of a display of curiosity than aggression. Instead make yourself as large as possible by raising your arms above your head, and talk to the bear in a calm, reassuring voice while slowly backing away. If the bear begins to move towards you, increase your volume - clap, yell, attempt to scare it away. While doing so, you might want to (slowly!) get that spray in hand and ready to go if you haven’t already done so. 

If the bear charges, our resident ranger recommends standing your ground and firing off bear spray when it is about 30 feet away - aiming low so the cloud envelops the bear’s face. This has proven overwhelmingly effective in encouraging the bear to break off it’s charge and retreat to tend to its burning eyeballs. In the event you don’t have any spray, can’t get the safety off, or encounter other issues, it’s time to prepare for a close encounter of the ursine kind.

While preparation and avoidance techniques are largely the same regardless of the species of bear, the general underlying guidelines if attacked do vary a bit depending on what type of bear is attacking you - so it helps to be able to tell the difference between the two primary species that inhabit the US (we’re going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you can spot a polar bear without our help). Regardless of their names, both species vary widely in color, so you’ll have to know where to look to spot the difference.

Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears)

Brown bears, also known as grizzly bears, are primarily found in Canada and the Northwestern US - Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Brown bears have a large pronounced hump on their back, as well as shorter rounded ears. Their claws are about double the length of those of black bears - though if you’re in range to measure their claws we’re willing to bet you have more pressing matters to deal with. 

If attacked by a brown bear, play dead. Drop down to the ground the instant before the animal makes contact. Keep your pack on to protect your back, lie down on your stomach, and use your arms to protect your head and the back of your neck. Remain still and silent. Even if the bear leaves, stay down until you’re 100% sure it’s gone - the idea is to present as little of a threat as possible. Try to sneak a peek around without moving too much to determine if the bear remains in the area - if not, get up and walk-don’t-run away from the area.

Black Bears

Black bears are typically a bit smaller than their brown counterparts, but are far more widespread - there have been reports of black bear sightings in 40 of the 50 United States! These days, they are most often found throughout the East Coast, all across California and the Pacific Northwest, as well as the Rockies and the Ozarks. Black bears have pointier ears than their grizzled counterparts, and for the most part are missing that large hump on their back. Black bears also tend to be far less aggressive, typically preferring to run away from threats or climb a tree to escape rather than defend themselves. 

If attacked by a black bear, fight back! Get as big and as loud as possible. Most black bears spook easily, and will want nothing to do with you if you make it clear you are not going down easily. Find nearby objects to use as weapons - rocks, branches, etc - and try to target sensitive areas such as the eyes or nose.

It's important to remember that in our outdoor excursions, we're intruding on the bears' territory, not vice versa. They were here first, they'll be here long after we're gone. Make sure to be prepared, but if you respect their space, give them a wide berth wherever possible, and follow these techniques, chances are extremely low they will ever pose any sort of threat to you.

Backcountry permitting is an important tool used by forest and wilderness personnel to preserve the integrity of outdoor spaces - both the beauty of nature itself, as well as the solitude it provides. Too many people on the trail can lead to damage to plantlife, alienation of crucial wildlife, increased risk of erosion and water pollution, and other various adverse effects on the environment. To ensure the safety of the natural resources we love so well, rangers need to implement permit regulations to help preserve the land for future generations to come. 

In speaking with current and former park officials, we’ve found that many people tend to be either unaware of the requirement for obtaining a permit for backcountry hiking/camping, or unfamiliar with the process by which to obtain one. Please consider this article as a resource to help lay out some important considerations, and ideally clear up some of the confusion surrounding backcountry permitting. 

And don’t worry! For the most part, fees associated with backcountry permits are nominal at best, and most (if not all) of the money spent goes directly back into preserving the land!

Plan in advance!  
 Your first step in the permitting process is to do some research on the area you’re planning to backpack in. Find out what land management agency is responsible for the area, so you can determine what sort of permits are required prior to your departure. We’ve provided links to some of the most common agencies at the bottom of this article. 

Bear in mind that some of the State and National Parks require reservations to be made anywhere from 3 months to an entire year in advance! You’ll want to check this first - you don’t want to spend all your time researching trails just to find out you won’t be able to hike any of them for months to come. Many of these areas have a lottery system for awarding permits, so if you have your heart set on a particular area, you’ll want to do your homework to figure out what sort of timing gives you the best chance to obtain a permit. Pay close attention to the lottery rules too, as some areas only give you a small window to confirm your reservation after the lottery concludes or else they’ll put it back up for grabs. 

If you’re having trouble finding pertinent information regarding your target area, you can always call the local ranger station for details. They’ll be able to direct you to the proper channels for permitting - and may provide you with some good recommendations for trails and campsites for your trip!

Map it out! 
 Get an idea of what trails you’d like to hike, and where you’d like to camp over the course of your trip. While this is a good strategy to identify how to prep and what you want to see in the region in general, in some cases backcountry permit applications require you to identify which dispersed sites or areas you’re targeting for camping when making your reservations. 


Arrive Early!
 Recognize that for some parks, reservations are entirely different from permits. In many cases, reservations must be converted to permits at the local ranger station on the morning of your trip (or in some cases 24 hours in advance), or else the reservation will be released for walk-up backpackers. It’s important to read your confirmation letter clearly, to ascertain what time you’ll need to arrive to secure your permit. If there is any confusion about this, contact the ranger station to be sure.

No reservation? No problem! (Hopefully)
 It’s important to note that the vast majority of wilderness areas set aside a good number of walk-up permits on a first-come first-serve basis - anywhere from 40-66% of permits won’t require a reservation in advance… if you can get to the ranger station before they run out. These walk-up permits are often free, and typically only available up to 24 hours prior to the date of your trip - so the earlier you arrive (within 24 hours of course), the better chance you have of securing a permit for yourself and/or your group. This is especially true in summer months, when good weather leads to increased competition for these permits.

Please remember that many locations that have offered walk-up permits in the past may be temporarily unable to offer this service due to office closures related to Covid-19. In some cases, such as at The Enchantments in Washington State, these walk-up permits are being re-released for reservation availability on a weekly basis. Check your destination’s website to see if any concessions are being made while the pandemic persists.

Call Ahead!
 It’s always a good idea to call the local ranger station a day or two before your trip for any last-minute information, especially if you’re planning on traveling a significant distance to get there. On rare occasions, disasters such as landslides, wildfires, or global pandemics can lead to trail closures, and may force alterations of your best-laid plans. A budget cut or, again, a global pandemic, could also cause in-person services to be closed, meaning there may be special instructions to secure your permit. A quick phone call in advance can potentially save a lot of hassle later. 


Resources!
 Here are some of the most common land management agencies that oversee hundreds of millions of acres of land throughout the United States:
Bureau of Land Management - If you’re looking in the Western US, there’s a good chance you’re looking at BLM land (they oversee 12% of the land area of the country, primarily in the Western and Pacific states.)

US Forest Service - Not all USFS lands require permits for backcountry trips, but many of the more popular ones do, especially in Wilderness Areas. It’s best to check in advance, just in case. 

US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service - FWS administers millions of acres of wildlife refuges throughout the country, many of which can be camped on.

National Park Service - The NPS governs many of the larger, more popular parks throughout the country. Keep in mind Covid restrictions tend to be even tighter in these areas, so be sure to do your homework prior to departure! The NPS is also a great resource to learn about proper bear safety techniques.

Recreation.gov - Use this site to book backcountry permits the same way you’d do so for developed campsites. 

Fire Permits - depending on the region, you may be required to obtain a fire permit when backcountry camping. They’re free, it’s responsible, and the process only takes a few minutes. 

Pathloom.com - we’re not biased or anything, and we may not manage millions of acres of land, but we think Pathloom is a great resource to help plan your trip!

What to Bring on a Dispersed Camping Trip
Dispersed Camping: A Two-Part Series
Part 2: What to Bring on a Dispersed Camping Trip, and How to Choose a Campsite

Photo by: Bryan Donoghue
 
Dispersed camping is an incredibly rewarding experience, provided one is properly prepared with everything needed for the trip in advance. We’ve previously covered what preparations to make at home before even packing the car for the trip. If you haven’t already done so, click here to review that list to make sure you have everything in order prior to packing. 

Photo by: Bryan Donoghue
When deciding what to bring on a dispersed camping trip, it’s important to consider how far you’ll have to hike from your car to your site. We’ve written this list with close proximity in mind - you can bring a lot more gear if you only have a 15 minute walk to get to your site versus backpacking for miles on end. With this in mind, redundancies are a very good idea - if you have the room for it, bring extra food, water, clothing, supplies, and anything else you can fit in your car!

We have also covered some non-essential items that aren’t 100% necessary for a dispersed trip, but are at least worth consideration to bring if you’ve got the room for them as they will make your experience much, much more pleasant. 

Finally, we’ll wrap up this series by providing some guidelines on how to pick the right location for your dispersed campsite - what to look out for, how to observe proper safety requirements, and how to leave everything the way you found it so the next camper to stumble upon the site can enjoy it as much as you did!

Photo by: Bryan Donoghue


What to bring on a dispersed camping trip:
 Shovel - perhaps the most essential dispersed camping tool.
Be fire safe! Bury your fire completely and entirely when you depart a site. Once you think it properly buried, put your hand over it. If it still feels warm, mix it around and bury it some more. Once it’s cool, go ahead and (carefully) put your hand directly into the ash and coals to check. If the coals can burn your hand, they can burn the forest down. Continue to mix &amp; bury until the coals are completely cool to the touch.
Bury your poop. Relieving yourself in nature isn’t the most fun part about camping, but it is absolutely, positively, going to be a part of your trip - and you want to be sure to follow a few simple rules when doing so. Some people like to lean against a tree, some hang off a tree, some just have themselves a squat. Whatever your preferred method, make sure to choose a location at least 200 feet from a water source to avoid potential contamination. Make sure you’re far enough away from trails and any campsite as well, as the scent of waste can potentially attract wildlife to your presence. Use your shovel to dig a hole at least 6 inches deep (preferably deeper) to bury your waste in. Ideally you would take your used toilet paper with you after you go (bring a ziplock bag!), but at the very least make sure whatever you use is biodegradable, and buried deep, deep underground. Use that shovel one more time afterwards to thoroughly bury everything in the hole before heading back to your site.

Toilet Paper - I don’t think we need to elaborate any further on this one. Bring plenty.

Lights! It gets awful dark at night when dispersed camping!
Flashlights - Keep one on you at all times, and keep a spare in your kit just in case. The ones with a string or lanyard attached can also serve as a lantern if you find something to hang it off of. Bring extra batteries.
Headlamps may look incredibly goofy, but they’re extremely useful when performing a task that requires both hands such as cooking, or relieving oneself. 

Firestarters - pick up a few lighters at a convenience store. Using flint &amp; tinder, or rubbing sticks together, is FAR easier said than done - to avoid extreme headaches just bring a lighter (and a second one as a backup). With most simple Bic lighters, even if they get waterlogged they’ll resume working once dried out - the same cannot be said for matches. 
Be sure to clear out the area around your fire ring of all brush and flammable objects for at least 5 feet in every direction prior to lighting your fire! 
If you plan to purchase firewood, make sure you do so locally to prevent the spread of invasive species - and buy extra, as you always go through more than you think you will!

Plastic Bags - plastic bags of all shapes and sizes always come in handy at the campsite, and take up such a small amount of space and weight in your kit. There really isn’t any reason not to bring plenty with you.
Trash bags are great for collecting your own waste, as well as anyone else’s that you might encounter along the trail. In a pinch, they can serve as great rain protection too - the high fashion of a Trash Bag Poncho, or a makeshift tarp overhead or under your tent to keep you dry. You can also use them to separate wet clothing from dry within your pack. Bring extras, just in case.
Ziplock bags are great for both keeping food fresh as well as storing leftovers for later. They’re also extremely effective for stashing and disposing of, shall we say, less fragrant waste items. 

Photo by: Bryan Donoghue

Blades and Other Pointy Things - the classic camping tools. Different people swear by different equipment, here’s a few to consider bringing. Remember: deadwood only! Never chop anything still alive!
A pocketknife is the most important item to bring with you on any kind of camping trip. You never know what’s going to need cutting - but it’ll come in handy far more times than you’d think. Consider bringing two - one for normal knifely duties, and one for food - it’s much more sanitary to keep those separate.
A folding handsaw or a good hatchet is extremely effective to chop up deadwood logs for the fire. Most hatchets can also double as a hammer for your tent stakes if you flip it around.

Rope - never underestimate the value of a good rope! Nylon is best, they’re plenty durable and extremely lightweight. 
When hiking, you can use the rope to tie off excess gear to your backpack.
At camp, you can use it to help make a shelter from the elements, as a clothesline, or to hang your food and trash high up in the trees to discourage wildlife from raiding your site while you sleep. 

First Aid Kit - consider it a little insurance policy. If an accident occurs in the middle of the wilderness, chances are there won’t be anyone around to help. Having a few key items can provide welcome relief in the face of potential disaster
Make sure your kit includes a whistle and/or a signal mirror. In a worst-case scenario where you are unable to help yourself, these can be lifesaving additions.

Water - unfortunately, it’s all but impossible to find clean, drinkable water out in nature in today’s day and age. Even if it looks clean, most natural water sources are infested with micro-organisms that can cause sickness and in extreme cases, death. The diarrhea and cramping associated with many of these water-borne illnesses aren’t fun to deal with at home, let alone out on the trail. Since there is no potable water available at a dispersed campsite, you’ll have to pack in everything you plan on utilizing - and then some!
Bringing your own water is certainly a safe option. Gallon jugs can be tied to your pack for easy transportation. If you freeze them the night before you head out, they can be used as icepacks to keep things cool as needed (just be sure to dump a little water out before freezing so the plastic doesn’t split)
There are a number of water treatment devices that are also viable options for dispersed camping, ranging from pumps, to filters, to tablets, to a good old fashioned pot to boil in. 
In all honesty, it’s a good idea to have some redundancy with your water arrangements, as you’ll need plenty for drinking, cooking, and dousing your campfire. If you’re bringing jugs, also bring a Lifestraw, or some tablets, or another treatment solution that doesn’t take up too much space in your kit. You can never be too safe when it comes to the availability of drinking water - the closest potable source might be dozens of miles from your site.

Food - food and cooking gear can (and eventually will) fill an entirely separate article. There is so much variance on what each camper prefers for their cooking kit. We’ve covered campfire cooking in the past and will certainly be doing so more in the future, so for now here are a few simple things to consider - in addition to what is on the menu.
Fork/knife/spoon/plate. A small, lightweight mess kit like this one should do the trick.
Salt, pepper, and olive oil make everything better. Well worth the room in your pack.
Coffee (OK, not food, but life-sustaining nonetheless). If you’re a coffee drinker, bring coffee, and do some homework in advance on a proper way to make it using what you have at your campsite. 
Aluminum foil is incredibly useful. Meat, veggies, or just about anything else can be wrapped up in foil and thrown on/in the fire to cook up. Bring a roll with you in your kit.
Camping stoves are extremely useful for a variety of applications at dispersed campsites, and are generally compact enough for easy transportation. Be sure to bring an extra canister of fuel!
Cast iron skillets are certainly not recommended if you have a long way to hike, but if not they are probably the best and most versatile way to cook over a campfire.

Non-Essential Amenities and Add-Ons for Dispersed Camping:
 Bandanas - multi-use - head covering, works as a rag if needed, makeshift Covid mask if you encounter other campers - they have a million uses and take up no space.
Sunscreen - Even if it seems overcast, UV rays can still cut through clouds. You’re better off with proper protection, nothing ruins a hike like a backpack rubbing on sunburnt shoulders.
Bug Spray - for deep woods trips, don’t try to go the organic all-natural route. We’ve all tried it 100 times before, and nothing works the way DEET works. We don’t say this too often, but when it comes to bug spray - go for the chemicals.
Compass, GPS, and satellite communicator - much more important the deeper you go into the wilderness!
Inflatable pillow - cheap, weighs nothing, takes up no room in your pack. Yet infinitely more enjoyable to rest your head on than the hard ground! 
Tarp - if the ground is wet, lay it out under your tent. If it’s overly sunny or rainy, string it up as a shelter.
Lantern - very nice way to light up your site at night. 
Extra socks - always bring more than you think you’ll need. 
Paper towels - folded up and off the roll so they take up less space, these are very nice to have as napkins, tissues, cleaning supplies, emergency TP, etc. 
Camping chairs and/or table - there won’t be any sort of picnic bench at a dispersed site.
Brush/mat - these are vital for keeping the inside of your tent clean
Recreation! Books, music (at a respectable volume of course), playing cards, cameras, telescopes, kayaks, mountain bikes - it’s your trip, make it as luxurious and entertaining as you’d like!

How to Choose a Campsite:
 With dispersed camping, it’s even more important to follow Leave No Trace principles when out in nature. It is paramount to not disturb any of the natural beauty around you - you want to keep things clean and wild for the next campers to come through the area. Make every attempt to re-use existing sites - use pre-established fire rings rather than making your own, and set up your tent on bare soil wherever possible to allow grass and plants to continue to grow unimpeded. 

Photo by: Bryan Donoghue
As dispersed sites tend to be far more overgrown and unkept than their ‘official’ counterparts, it becomes even more important to abide by fire regulations and practice fire safety - illegal campfires and campfires not extinguished properly at dispersed sites cause wildfires to break out every year. Make sure any brush or anything potentially flammable is cleared at least 5 feet away from your fire ring to avoid catastrophe. 

If you are unable to locate any pre-existing campsites to utilize and must make your own, it’s a good thing you were so well prepared to do so! Make sure to set up at least 200 feet away from any water sources to avoid potential contamination or damage to fragile plantlife. Give a wide berth to any developed campgrounds, park areas, or trailheads, as camping near established recreational areas is typically prohibited. 

Pick a site that isn’t right in the middle of a clearing, as you want to be inconspicuous and not mar the beauty of the area in any way. You don’t want to tarnish a beautiful meadow with a fire ring and a tent-sized patch of dead grass - go to the very edge whenever possible. That being said, if you are planning on any sort of fire (even a camping stove or fire pan!), make sure there are no low hanging branches overhead that could potentially ignite. Be smart, be safe, and be considerate towards those to come after you've gone.
 
Dispersed camping is simultaneously exhilarating and serene - exciting to get in touch with nature, experience the outdoors free of the trappings of modern society, and the ultimate way to detach from the ‘civilized’ world and get in touch with your roots, as well as your inner self. Prepare accordingly, pack inclusively, and get outdoors to experience it for yourself!

How to Plan for a Dispersed Camping Trip
Dispersed Camping: A Two-Part Series
Part 1: How to Plan for a Dispersed Camping Trip
Photo by: Bryan Donoghue 
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our communities, established campgrounds continue to be overwhelmed with the increase of traffic to their sites. You may have found that many of your go-to camping areas are now booked up for weeks or months in advance. You may be a newcomer that wanted to try out camping this season, but were discouraged when you were unable to find a proper site. Rather than letting these circumstances prevent you from a desperately needed outdoors escape, consider another option - dispersed camping. 

Dispersed camping is known by many names, and comes in many different forms. Primitive camping, backcountry camping, overlanding, boondocking - all are variants of what is referred to as dispersed camping. The common thread throughout all these variations is that you are camping in an area with no designated campsite - no facilities, no potable water, no picnic table or grill, no ranger station to check into upon arrival - none of the things one is accustomed to seeing at a typical developed campground. The lack of these amenities can make for an incredibly exciting and rewarding experience, but only if one is properly prepared.

In this two-part series, we will lay out how dispersed camping differs from typical car camping at a developed campground - in terms of what to plan for in advance and what to bring on the trip. These articles have been written with dispersed car camping in mind, rather than an extensive backpacking trip - meaning the weight of what you are bringing is not as impactful as it might be if you had to hike for miles before setting up camp. 

In this article, we have covered how to properly plan for a dispersed camping trip - what you will need to do before leaving your house. In part two, to be released in just a few days, we will review the essentials you’ll need to pack your car up with, with an emphasis on what is needed in a dispersed situation in addition to what you’d bring on a ‘normal’ trip.

What to do before a dispersed camping trip:
 
Call the rangers (ex. your destination’s local Forest Service or BLM offices):
Check to see if any dispersed camping permits are necessary in the area. Permitting is an important strategy utilized by rangers to ensure an area doesn’t become overcrowded, which can lead to damage or destruction of natural beauty.
Check fire conditions in the destination area: are there any active wildfires nearby that could impact your trip? Are you allowed to build a campfire considering the current weather conditions? Do you need to obtain a Fire Permit for the area in which you’re camping?

Check the local weather forecast, and plan accordingly. Bring a beanie and a heavy jacket if it’s going to be cold, rain gear if there’s a chance of precipitation, etc.

Check the local Air Quality Index (AQI). This is especially important on the west coast this year, where wildfires are having an immense impact on the breathability of the air even hundreds of miles from their active location!

Familiarize yourself with natural hazards and plan accordingly. Be able to spot poison ivy/oak/sumac - and stay far, far away from it. Know how to protect yourself (and your food!) from regional wildlife in the unlikely event you encounter any.

Clean your boots. Dirt from previous trips can contain seeds that introduce invasive species into new areas, which can have disastrous effects on local plant-life. 

Preparing food prior to your departure can make life much easier at the campsite. Here are a few articles on meal ideas.



Vehicle check - if you’re traveling off the beaten path, make sure your car is ready for the trip!
Ensure you’re equipped with a spare tire, portable jump starter, snow chains, etc. A bag of sand or kitty litter works wonders to get your car out of mud or snow. 
Look into the road quality leading to your preferred camping area. Often you’ll find yourself on uneven dirt roads that not all vehicles can handle! Trust your instincts - if the road seems too rocky, or narrow, or otherwise harrowing - turn around when safe to do so and find a new location! 
Plan your route in advance:
Pick a general area for your trip, and have a few backup ideas just in case your initial location is occupied. Identify several roads within that area that would be proper targets, look at satellite imagery online and perhaps consult the local rangers for ideal sites. For worst-case scenarios, have a developed site or hotel in mind as a backup plan in the event you can’t find a proper unoccupied dispersed site.
Have paper maps AND maps pre-downloaded on your phone. Paper maps are good insurance against your phone running out of battery while you’re out. Ensure everyone in your group also has their offline maps situated as well.
Remember that you can’t camp near campgrounds, picnic areas, or trailheads - make sure the campsite(s) you have in mind are far enough away from these landmarks to comply with local regulations. Explore the area after identifying a site to make sure you’re not on someone else’s campground, or a trail. 
Plan to camp at least 100 feet from any stream or water source. The vegetation that grows near water tends to be far more fragile, meaning you could end up having a far more negative impact on the area than you intended. 
Check local limits on the duration of stay in any particular area - many regions prohibit dispersed camping in a single area for more than 14 days at a time.
Understand that recreating during the Covid-19 pandemic can present additional challenges that need to be addressed - read our article on the subject to ensure you’re prepared!
Make sure everyone accompanying you on your trip is as well-prepared as you are for your dispersed camping experience! 
 
The key to dispersed camping, as with so many other outdoor adventures, is proper preparation. Since nothing is provided to you at the site, you’ll need to put in the work in advance to ensure you’ll be able to enjoy and appreciate the experience. Do so, and your trip will be unforgettable. Don’t do so, and your trip may still be unforgettable, just not quite in the way you’d want it to be! Check back into Pathloom in a few days for part two of this series, covering everything you need to bring with you for an incredible dispersed camping experience!

A Newcomer’s Guide to Experiencing the Outdoors during Covid

Photo Credit: Kadir Celep
 

As the dark cloud of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to linger over society and compromise many of our traditional forms of recreation, people are heading out into the great outdoors in record numbers as a means of physical and mental escape. 

The sheer number of new campers and hikers, coupled with high winds and weather conditions that lead to high risk for wildfires and other catastrophes, makes it all the more important that people inform themselves prior to getting outdoors in terms of how to keep both themselves and their environs safe. Some states, such as Colorado, are making concerted efforts to reach out to this audience with campaigns designed to educate and inform regarding site and trail etiquette. The United States Forest Service also offers plenty of advice for dispersed camping and the like. Pathloom has previously published an article on recreating safely during the pandemic. . The resources are out there, and the effort is being made to welcome newcomers to the great outdoors and get this information into the hands of the people who need it, but there remain countless examples of negligent behavior on the part of those escaping to the wilderness, exacerbated by sheer numbers.

The communities that surround these campsites have been hard at work seeking solutions to this influx of campers in their areas. Some have proven effective, others - not so much. In some cases, efforts to prevent this careless destruction have only made things worse, perpetuating a vicious cycle that serves neither the land nor the people who care for it. Rangers in the Boise National Forest in Idaho are looking into shutting regular and dispersed campsites down to give the grounds time to rehab. But that often leads to campers just pulling off and setting up on the side of the road when they are unable to find a proper site. And as officials on California’s Mendocino coast have found, that can lead to “unsafe and unsanitary conditions” on the side of the road when campers, especially those with RV’s, dump their waste (both organic and non-organic) on the roadside since they are unable to utilize the proper facilities found at the designated areas they’re accustomed to. Closing sites also has an immense impact on the revenue generated by local businesses as well as the towns themselves on the taxes from such properties, which has already and will continue to have a serious impact on local and regional budgeting. For many of these rural areas, the revenue generated from outdoor activities is one of the primary drivers for their regional economies, making it imperative that some sort of solution be found sooner rather than later.

So it starts with the campers, the hikers, the people who love the outdoors to show that love, to avoid negligence, to take care of the land that has taken care of them time and time again. We need to be responsible if we are to sustain the natural beauty that surrounds us, so that future generations can continue to enjoy nature the way we can today.

What can you do to help? While it may seem like a daunting task to “save the world”, the first step is to just to maintain a sense of personal responsibility in your outdoor activities - and maybe take it a bit further if and when you are able to. 
Are you a camper? Make sure you add a shovel to your kit - bury your human waste deep enough so it won’t be unearthed, and use it to thoroughly smother your fire when you depart from your site. Unburied waste can easily contaminate local water sources, and nobody wants to be the one responsible for the next massive wildfire that obliterates hundreds of thousands of acres.
Are you a hiker? Not littering will obviously help - but maybe bring a trash bag (or even just a coffee bean bag!) with you, perhaps a set of rubber gloves, and pick up trash along the trail as you see it. September is Clean Trails Month, after all! 
Walking your dog? Keep them on a leash, to minimize any potential interaction with wildlife. Bring poop bags, and don’t just leave the bags after bagging it up. They’d take care of it themselves if they only had thumbs. 
Just want to get out into nature to have a few socially-distant drinks with some friends? Consider cans instead of bottles. Accidents happen, and it’s much easier to pick up a can off the ground than shattered glass. Plus, crushed empty cans take up a lot less room in your trash bag and are a lighter haul for your trek back into civilization. 
Pay attention to posted signs, read the notice boards at trailheads - the rangers and land management officials have more experience than anyone else tending to their respective lands, and have devoted significant amounts of their time learning how best to sustain them. 

We did a comprehensive piece on the seven Leave No Trace principles in our blog a few weeks ago. It’s a quick and easy list of ways to ensure you preserve the land when you’re out enjoying all that it has to offer. Give it a read here, and if you’d like more information check out the Leave No Trace homepage here.

The Resilience of the Redwoods: Big Basin’s Rise from the Ashes
Bryan Donoghue, Guest Blogger

The birds are starting to return, even as the forest floor smolders around the base of their roosts. Animals begin to trickle back into the park grounds, even as firefighters work to fell scorched Douglas Fir trees before they come crashing down on the behemoth Redwoods that surround them. Though many of the structures built by humans lie in ruins, nature carries on at Big Basin State Park, just outside Boulder Creek deep in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The CZU Lightning Complex wildfire raged fiercely, and indeed threatened total devastation, but in the end it will just be another bout of adversity overcome by the 2,000 year old forest.

Over the centuries, Big Basin has evolved from a largely homogenous grove of coast Redwoods into a diverse ecosystem of Douglas Firs, Madrones, and Oaks scattered throughout the old growth. While at first glance this only serves to add to the beauty of the park, it has the unfortunate side effect of making the area increasingly susceptible to wildfires. It may seem counterintuitive, but the occasional fire can be beneficial to California Redwoods - fire enriches the soil and allows redwood seedlings to grow, while also clearing out more flammable species that could ignite the canopy were disaster to strike. There is ample evidence of indiginous peoples native to this area prescribing burns to ensure the Redwoods remained safe. But while Redwoods may be resistant to fire, the same can’t be said for the other species of trees - or the the 70+ year old buildings scattered throughout the park grounds. 

The store where campers buy firewood? Gone. The 84-year-old headquarters building where hikers or mountain bikers could get maps of the trail system? Gone. So many of the bridges, the fences, and the other man-made structures found throughout the park were destroyed, yet, for the most part, the Redwoods remain. The resilience of these trees in the face of an apocalyptic inferno is nothing short of incredible - their thick bark provides significant protection against the flames, and in the event the fire does penetrate that defense, they can survive and even regenerate themselves even when the majority of their heartwood has been burnt out.

Humans have shown similar resilience amidst these wildfires sweeping across California, Colorado, and throughout much of the western United States. As wildfires descend upon communities and cause rampant destruction, humans across the country have shown that they too can survive and regenerate. The herculean efforts devoted to containing the fire, the tireless work to safely evacuate threatened areas, the blood, sweat, and tears shed as people begin to rebuild their devastated homes and communities. The fact that such destruction is occurring at the same time as a global pandemic and widespread social unrest seems to be an insurmountable challenge, but humans have faced worse and will overcome once more. Our hearts go out to everyone facing disaster, and we salute your determination to rebuild and regrow. If you’d like to help those impacted by these fires, please follow this link to the California Community Foundation’s Wildfire Relief Fund:

 Big Basin
Through the valiant efforts of the firefighters, rangers, and other emergency personnel Big Basin will be preserved, will live, and will one day again become a popular destination for outdoor activities (current estimate is not before next year). The iconic Mother and Father of the Forest trees are safe - for now, and will continue to preside over the oldest state park in California. The extent of the damage wrought by the fire has yet to be fully assessed, but as the containment rate rises we can remain hopeful that this and countless other parks across the country will one day open up again for camping, hiking, mountain biking, trail running, and countless other outdoor activity opportunities. But neither containment nor rebuilding efforts are free - parks like Big Basin cannot reopen without significant investment. If you’ve ever enjoyed the natural beauty Big Basin has to offer, consider giving a little back to aid the monumental task of reconstruction. Follow this link to the Sempervirens Fund’s Big Basin Recovery Fund and pitch in what you can:

Easy Four-Ingredient Ramen Recipe

Photo by Shreya Swaika
 
Who says you cannot be luxurious in the backcountry? You do not have to eat pre-packaged freeze-dried meals every night on each trip. There are numerous ways to get creative and still eat like royalty during a backpacking trip. It is only fair, considering how hungry one gets at the end of a long day hauling around that big backpack! That is why we at Pathloom have decided to share this deliciously easy Ramen recipe that will not fail to disappoint. Noodle dishes are great as the packets are light-weight and come with seasoning - thereby ridding you of the extra step of assembling a spice mix. 

This recipe is ideal for a 2-4 day trip and should be consumed during the first or second day. It can be quite filling, and we recommend it for dinner. But hey, if ramen is your breakfast favorite, go for it all the same 😉 It is a single-portion recipe, so if you are with more people and like to share, feel free to multiply the ingredients accordingly. We have included pepperoni sticks as an optional ingredient, mostly out of convenience since pepperoni is a good trail snack, and we figured if you have it handy, why not add it to your noodles for some extra protein! It also contains egg, so if you are plant-based, leave that out.

Easy Ramen Veggie and Egg Bowl
 
Ingredients

1 packet of your favorite Ramen noodles
½ a Pepper (yellow/green/red)
A handful of dehydrated or fresh mushrooms*
1 boiled egg
Optional: 2 Pepperoni sticks

*dehydrated black shitake mushrooms can be easily purchased at grocery stores or outdoor stores.

Preparation

At home
Step 1: Boil 1 egg - Put the egg in a pot and cover with water. Put the pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Once the water is on a rolling boil, put off the heat and cover for 12 minutes. Then peel the egg and transfer to a zip lock bag.
Step 2: Finely chop the pepper, place in a bag and seal. Do the same for the mushrooms. If using dehydrated, they can be broken up by hand.
 In the backcountry 
Step 1: In a medium saucepan, add 500 ml of water, and bring to boil.
If using dehydrated mushrooms, first boil 300 ml of water and add the mushrooms to the pot. Boil for another 6-7 minutes or until mushrooms are soft. Then follow steps 1 - 3.
Step 2: Add Ramen noodles along with the included spice packets and vegetables, stir, and bring to boil. If adding pepperoni sticks, using the back of your spork, cut them into little chunks and add. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, and keep the lid on.
Step 3: Remove from heat. Cut the egg in half and place on top. Let it cool slightly and enjoy.

Tips and tricks
Write brief cooking instructions and water amounts on the zip-lock with a sharpie, or screenshot/print this recipe.
Use the ziplock bag as a garbage bag once the contents have been emptied into the saucepan.
While dehydrated mushrooms are lighter and more packable, do not hesitate to take some chopped fresh mushrooms, especially if you are planning to make this meal on the first day. Fresh mushrooms will be quicker as you will not have to rehydrate them.

We hope that this recipe satisfies your craving while in the backcountry!

Leave No Trace Principles

Photo from Unsplash
 Leave no Trace
As more and more people head out to the trails this year, we are beginning to see the impact on our great outdoors. Understandably, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a greater number of people are looking into alternative ways of vacationing. The most popular one is camping. While this is a welcomed change as it means that more people will begin to appreciate the wonders of being outside, it also means that we need to be extra careful about the steps we can take to reduce our impact after an outdoor trip - be it a quick day trip picnicking or hiking, or a multi-day adventure in the backcountry. This article by CBC News reiterates the point that as more people try camping for the first time, especially in the backcountry, the impact is becoming very evident. We may not even realize it, but the surrounding plants, animals, and ecosystems are affected by every trip we make. In this article, we will discuss several ways in which you can reduce your footprint and make a difference.

There are seven main principles that are universal to “Leave no Trace”. They are:

1. Plan ahead and prepare: 
It is always good practice to research the area you are entering, and know the regulations of the area so you can adhere to them. 
Try to visit at lower-traffic times so as to avoid overcrowding - it is becoming an issue this summer to the point that roads are being shut down to avoid larger-than-usual crowds from negatively impacting the parks.
Have a means of navigation so as to avoid having to mark routes with paint, rock cairns, or flags.
2. Travel and camp on durable surfaces: 
Durable surfaces include maintained trails and designated campsites, rock, gravel, sand, dry grasses or snow. 
Camp at least 200 feet from lakes and streams, and keep campsites small when possible.
3. Dispose of waste properly: this applies to everything from human waste and litter to grit water. 
Pack it in, pack it out - any kind of waste that you have brought in must be packed out, this includes bio-degradable waste such as banana or orange peels (a common misconception that since it is a fruit, it is okay to dispose of on a trail). Inspect the campsite before you leave for spills and litter.
Use outhouses wherever provided. Deposit solid human waste in catholes dug 6 to 8 inches deep, at least 200 feet from water, camp, and trails. Cover and disguise the cathole when finished.
To wash yourself or your dishes, carry water 200 feet away from streams or lakes and use small amounts of biodegradable soap. Scatter strained dishwater.
4. Leave what you find: preserve the past by examining and photographing. 
Do not touch cultural or historic structures and artifacts.
Leave rocks, plants and other natural objects as you find them.
Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species - clean your equipment between trips.
 5. Minimize campfire impacts:
Where fires are permitted, use established fire rings, fire pans, or mound fires.
Keep fires small. Use only sticks from the ground that can be broken by hand.
6. Respect wildlife: remember that you are entering their habitat and be respectful of their space.
Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow or approach them.
Never feed animals. Feeding wildlife damages their health alters natural behaviors and exposes them to predators and other dangers.
Protect wildlife and yourself by storing your food (including any items that have a smell such as toothpaste, deodorant, etc.) and trash securely.
7. Be considerate of other visitors:
Be respectful of other visitors - yield on the trail and avoid loud noises and voices.
Manage your pet.
We hope that this article has helped you understand the measures you can take to be respectful while enjoying the outdoors. It is crucial that we preserve and conserve our forest and wildlands, and as we increase our use of these spaces, we understand how important a role each of us plays in maintaining them. If this article has piqued your interest, dip deeper and explore the official Leave no Trace website.

    <title>Launching a Startup is an Adventure</title>

Launching a Startup is an Adventure

Photo by Ankit Jain
 
Ankit, the Founder of Pathloom, shares some insights into his journey of starting a company and how he sees it as one of his adventures in the outdoors.
 Launching a startup is like embarking on a journey, whether it is a lengthy road trip, a long-distance hike, a backpacking trip, or perhaps best of all, a several hundred- or thousand-mile thru-hike. The commonality is that you are embarking upon a journey with a final destination or goal in mind. However, to get there, it is really all about the journey and taking it one step at a time. 

Photo by Ankit Jain
 There are many pieces of the puzzle involved in planning such trips, and the same applies to launching a startup. I often get excited when thinking of an extended trip, but to put it into action, I need to first figure out where I am going to stay, what trails are nearby, how much food and water I need and what gear to pack. Similarly, identifying the problem-solution space, evaluating the market and business opportunity, understanding the competitive space, creating a data-driven business plan and go-to-market strategy and forming a product roadmap are all part of the process when considering an effective way to plan for your business before diving in too deep.

 Planning a trip
When planning a trip for which there is not much information available, I find it very useful to connect with others who might have done something similar or might have some insights into the area that I am traveling to. It is often a hit or miss situation if I just go somewhere without much knowledge or preparation as I might be putting my safety at risk. Similarly, when launching a startup, you are often in the territory of creating something new and innovating. Hence learning from others' insights and talking to your prospective customers early-on enables you to learn a lot about your business, product and market from the get-go rather than potentially launching something that might not fit the needs of the customer or even potentially jeopardizing the business.

Photo by Ankit Jain
 I might start an adventure off with a few friends or on my own, but there are always amazing people that I meet along the way. They become a part of my journey and enhance my overall experience. A startup is not so different - you might start a company with a co-founder or on your own, and it is the people you meet along the way that enable greater success for your startup. Whether it is friends and family, mentors, advisors, team members, customers or investors, they all become part of the journey. Some become part of the journey more than others. These people are your 'tramily' -- a term often used in the thru-hiking community to refer to your trail family. A rockstar team is crucial to a startup, especially as things become more complex and the needs grow of the company. Let us call it our 'stramily' -- our startup family.

Often during many of my hikes, there are some adverse situations and challenges to overcome. Whether it is navigation, the terrain, long-water carries, weather, or a steep climb or descent, it is these challenges that make a hike memorable and experiential, and ultimately rewarding. Likewise, there are many uphills and downhills in the startup journey where one must navigate through adversities and challenges. These experiences certainly help with growth for both the people involved and the company itself. After a while, you will start to feel as if things are cruising, and it is then that you should stop and reflect whether you want to challenge yourself further. 

As you can see, whether you are planning your next adventure or venture, it is not so different.

Top 5 Snacks For a Hike

 Snacks For a Hike
When heading out on a day hike, one of the common things people forget about is keeping themselves fed! It is perplexing to think about after the fact, but it is so easy to underestimate our own energy levels and the amount of time spent on the hike itself. We have all made that mistake at least once in our lives, be it on a hike, during a road trip, or just on a day out. The main reason it is important to plan ahead and pack some nutritious snacks when going hiking is because unlike a day out in the city, there are no shops in the outdoors that you can stop at last-minute! Yes, we are all thinking the same thing - food on demand would be great, but until we figure out a way to get food delivery services right on the trails, we will have to make do with pre-packing our snacks! 

Let us jump right into Pathloom’s top 5 suggestions for healthy, yummy and nutritious trail snacks:

1. Trail mix - This is a common and quite popular trail snack (as the name suggests!). Dried- fruits combined with nuts, seeds, toasted corn, etc. and sometimes even M&amp;Ms are a great source of nutrition and can be eaten at any time. It can either be bought pre-packaged, or you can get creative and buy the ingredients separately and mix it all up.

2. Nutrition bar - This is the easiest, hassle-free trail snack. If you are feeling low on energy and need a boost, pull out a nutrition bar and you will be ready to go. They are packed with proteins, fibers, fats, and carbohydrates. There are numerous brands that make nutrition bars, so make sure to read the nutrition facts to find the right one for you. Our top 3 favorites are Cliff bars, Lara bars, and Kind bars.

3. Oranges - There is nothing better than a quick refreshing snack on a warm day! Oranges contain vitamin C and due to their juicy and sweet nature, they serve as the perfect trail snack when you are feeling parched or your mouth is dry. They do not get squished easily in a backpack and do not need refrigeration.

4. Cheese and crackers - If you do not mind stopping for a lunch or snack break during your hike, cheese and crackers are a slightly more luxurious yet easy trail snack! It is a good source of protein, calcium, and fat and can be quite filling. Keep in mind that the cheese must be on the more processed side, as very fresh cheese cannot go long without refrigeration, especially when it is warm out.

5. Pepperoni sticks, jerky - Craving some salty deliciousness? Pepperoni sticks and jerky are a great source of protein, and coincidentally happen to be really tasty! If you do not eat meat, plant-based jerky options are available in stores as well.

Try packing these snacks on your next day hike. They are quick, easy, and hassle-free. Always remember to pack a little bit extra in case you end up hiking longer than expected or need to spot a friend who forgot their own snacks.

Easy Backpacking Dinner Recipe

Photo by Shreya Swaika
 
Packing and planning meals for a backpacking trip can be quite a challenge sometimes, especially if you are a foodie! It is so convenient to go to an outdoor store and buy freeze-dried meals, but really, how many of those can you eat before you start to crave some real, fresh, yummy food?

If you are going on a short 3 or 4-day backpacking trip, treat yourself with a light-weight yet deliciously healthy meal on the first night, so you can start off the trip feeling rejuvenated. The recipe we have in mind is easy, quick, and does not require a dehydrator. However, if you do have one, you have the option of using it to reduce some of the weight.


SPICED LEMON COUSCOUS WITH VEGETABLES 
 
Ingredients

1 cup uncooked couscous
2 tsp Garlic powder seasoning
1 ½ tsp Curry powder seasoning
A pinch of Lemon salt*
1 Yellow/Red/Green/Orange Pepper
A handful of cherry tomatoes
¼ Cucumber 
2 tsp dried parsley

* Can be substituted with freshly squeezed Lemon juice

Preparation

At home
Step 1: Add the curry powder, garlic powder, and dried parsley to the couscous.
Step 2: Finely chop the pepper. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Chop the cucumber in little pieces. Mix all of the vegetables in a bag and seal.
Step 3: If you are using lemon juice instead of lemon salts, squeeze 2 tablespoons of lemon juice into a separate bag, and remember to add a pinch of salt to the bag with the couscous mix. 

In the backcountry 
Step 1: In a medium saucepan, add 2 cups (500ml) of water, and bring to boil.
Step 2: Add couscous mix and vegetable mix, stir, and bring to boil.
Step 3: Remove from heat. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Add lemon salts or lemon juice. Mix well and enjoy!

Tips and tricks

Remove the couscous from its original packaging and put it in a ziplock bag, mix the spices in the bag and seal it. This will reduce the amount of space it takes in your backpack.
Write brief cooking instructions and water amounts on the zip-lock with a sharpie, so you do not have to scratch your brain at the end of a long day trying to remember how to cook it.
Use the ziplock bag as a garbage bag once the contents have been emptied into the saucepan.
If you cannot find lemon salts, lemon juice is a great alternative. You can either squeeze the lemon juice to reduce weight or just cut a wedge and add it to the bag of vegetables.

Give this recipe a try on your next backpacking or camping adventure, and you will not be disappointed!

Thruhiking vs. Backpacking

Photo from Unsplash
 
Ever talked to an outdoorsy person and wondered what they meant when describing their latest “thruhike”? What about someone describing their recent “backpacking trip”? In this article, we will explain the difference and clear up the confusion around these terms.

What is Thruhiking?

The term thruhiking is popular in the U.S and is commonly associated with the Appalachian Trail (A.T), Pacific Crest Trail (P.C.T), or the Continental Divide Trail(C.D.T). It is a long-distance, end-to-end hiking trail that is usually completed in one straight shot. To give you an idea of the distances we are talking about, the Appalachian Trail is more than 2100 miles long while the Pacific Crest Trail is over 2600 miles. This can take anywhere between 6-12 months and is commonly done solo. Shorter thruhikes are also an option, but for the purposes of this article, we will discuss the extremely long-distance trails.

What is backpacking?

A backpacking trip is when you go on a multi-day hike. It is essentially an extended hike into an area that you would like to explore further. It can be end-to-end, a loop, or even out-and-back. Most backpacking trips are between 3-7 days long. To learn more about backpacking, read our article Is Backpacking For Me.

What is the difference between Backpacking and Thruhiking?

1. Physical ability - Since you are walking for miles on end for weeks or months at a time, physical ability plays a big role in the decision to embark on a thruhike. While backpacking also requires some level of physical fitness, along with a good hiking knapsack, it is less demanding than a thruhike, purely due to its shorter and quicker nature. When planning a thruhike, you need to train and prepare yourself (and your feet!) for the hundreds of miles you are about to walk. Since the terrain being covered on a thruhike varies vastly, you are posed with other physical challenges such as altitude sickness, Lyme disease, or even reoccurring blisters.
 2. Mental capability - Thruhikes are usually done solo. Although you will meet people en route, most of the time spent hiking is by yourself. The biggest mental challenge on a thruhike is pushing past your internal barriers, pushing your body past its limits, dealing with bouts of loneliness and self-doubt, and mentally preparing yourself to get through the entire journey. Solo backpacking is also popular, so the loneliness factor is still something to consider. However, due to the shorter nature of backpacking trips, the mental challenge is not as significant as it would be on a thruhike.
 3. Gear - This is a very important distinction between thruhiking and backpacking gear. With thruhiking, the weight of the gear becomes crucial due to the length of the trip. Thruhikers focus on light-weight and efficient gear while backpackers can often afford to hike with bulkier and heavier gear. 
 4. Time commitment - 6 months to a year is a long time to be away from work and family, and a source of income. It is also a long time to potentially be solo on the trail. Making that kind of commitment is essential for a successful thruhike. Backpacking trips can be as short as a weekend and can be planned around your own schedule.
 Hopefully, this article has given you an idea of what thruhiking is and how it differs from backpacking. If you are looking for a challenging, soul-searching, liberating journey, then consider thruhiking! It might be your calling.

5 Essentials For a Day Hike

Photo by Shreya Swaika
 Hiking season
Hiking season is upon us, and here at Pathloom, we want to make sure you are prepared to hit the trails with confidence! We have compiled a list of the 5 most essential items you will need for your next day hike. If you are new to hiking and are wondering if you should give it a shot, read our 5 Reasons To Start Hiking This Summer.
 Now back to the essentials. Here is a quick and handy list that you should use on any hike you decide to do, whether it is a few hours or all day.
 1. Water - Carry at least 1L of water on any day hike. Depending on how long you plan to be out, plan to carry more water, or a water purification system if there is a water source en route.

2. Food and Snacks - Regardless of the length of the trail, always pack emergency long-lasting snacks such as nutrition bars and dry nuts. It is also important to carry some extra food in case you end up hiking longer than expected.

3. First-aid kit - A pre-packaged hiking first-aid kit from any outdoor store or a personally compiled one is a must on any outdoor excursion. At a bare minimum, be sure to include tape, bandages, and wound protection. The size of this kit will vary based on the level of risk being taken.

4. Layers - Even if the forecast is sunny and warm, it is important to carry some protection for unforeseen weather changes. At a minimum, you should have a light, breathable waterproof jacket. Supplement this with a fleece or wool layer if you are hiking in colder climates.

5. Sun Protection - Long exposure to the sun has many lasting effects and many more immediate and uncomfortable consequences. The best way to avoid a nasty burn is to pack a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.
 Keep in mind that these items are only essentials. Based on your preferences and needs you can choose to add more to your backpack. This list should give you an idea of the basic things required for a safe and successful hike, and as long as you have the items mentioned above, you will be prepared for the outdoors. 

In the current Covid-19 world that we live in, outdoor activities can seem daunting or confusing at first. Read our thoughts on How to Recreate Safely During the Coronavirus Pandemic.

  Thinking about backpacking, but not sure what you need to bring with you? 
It can be a little intimidating at first to compile all the items required for a successful backpacking trip. There are a million different things one can pack, depending on preferences and suitability. 

But there will always be those few specific items that one simply cannot depart without- keep in mind that these are only essentials. Since each of us is unique and has varying needs, you may want to add a few more items for your comfort, as you know yourself best.

Here at Pathloom, we have compiled a list of the eight most essential items you will need for your next backpacking trip. 


Navigation

A topographic map and a compass will be very useful when venturing into the backcountry. Knowing how to map read and use a compass is of course important, as the last thing you want is to be lost and not know how to use your navigation tools! An altimeter will enhance the accuracy of this information as you can compare your elevation to the information on the map. Remember to store your map in a waterproof case! 

A good alternative to this is a GPS, as it will give you accurate information on your location, and help you navigate with pre-loaded maps. Most outdoor GPSs are designed to be water-resistant and rugged. 

Another option is using an app such as Pathloom’s (upcoming) to track and navigate directly from your mobile device. Lastly, you could consider bringing an SOS device. The only time it is acceptable to not have at least one of the above items is if you are doing a very short and obvious backpacking route, on a trail which is very well maintained with constant and clear signage.

Nutrition 

To ensure that you will have the energy to get through your backpacking trip, you will need to carry adequate food to last for the entire duration of your trip, plus an extra day. Planning for the unknown is key when entering the backcountry, and it is crucial to have extra food in case external factors such as unforeseen weather or injury forces you to extend your stay. 

The extra food should be something that does not need to be cooked, such as protein bars, trail mix, or jerky (vegan jerky options are available).

Hydration 

Always carry at least 1L of drinkable water with you, even if it is a short hike-in. It is important to always be prepared in case plans change. When heading out into the backcountry, a means to filter water is necessary. Water filters, water purification tablets or droplets work well and provide a great backup in times of need.

Shelter

Since you are embarking on a multi-day adventure, you will need a shelter in which to sleep every night. This can be anything from a tent to a bivy. There are many combinations and options available to you in this regard - depending on the climate, you can opt to take just a sleeping bag and a pre-made emergency bivy, or a tent and sleeping bag. 

The decision to carry a sleeping bag and mat is entirely dependent on the weight that you are willing to carry, and the nighttime temperatures you expect. 

Illumination 

Having a way to see where you are going around the campsite after the sun sets is essential, as the last thing you want is to have an injury because you could not see! It is also good to have a means of illumination in case you are forced to hike longer than expected, and you encounter darkness. 

The most efficient and handy tool is a headlamp.  It allows you to free up your hands to perform other tasks while illuminating the way ahead. Each group member should have an individual headlamp, along with spare batteries, or a rechargeable variant.

Insulation 

Carrying extra layers is a blessing in disguise! It can be shocking how quickly temperatures drop with the sun setting or a sudden onset of inclement weather. This is especially important if you are gaining elevation, as the temperatures drop the higher up you go. 

The most essential item that should be in your backpack every trip is a rain and wind-proof, light but breathable jacket. In addition, depending on the climate in which your trip is taking place, consider packing a fleece or wool layer. Both these fabrics will provide insulation even when wet. When you combine the outer jacket with the inner insulator, it will keep you adequately warm. 

If you are hiking in colder/alpine climates, it is always a good idea to have protection for your head and your hands, even in the summer. A light pair of gloves and a hat or broad headband will come in handy when you least expect it. 

Remember that a backpacking trip means you will be exposed to the elements longer than on a usual hike, so being prepared for changing weather is essential.

Emergency Equipment 

Heading into the wilderness requires emergency planning. Certain tools required for unexpected circumstances are an absolute must, and cannot be left behind on any trip, regardless of the location or climate. 

First-aid kit – The size of the kit will depend on the size of the group and the level of risk being taken. It is vital, as it will be your only immediate option if there is an injury. It can be bought pre-packaged, or one can combine the required items and make their own. Bandages, antiseptic creams, gauze pads, blister it, painkillers, anti-inflammatory, and nitrile gloves should be included at a minimum. 

Emergency fire-starter – In case the weather gets too cold or too wet, or you need a means of illumination or smoke, a fire-starting kit will be helpful. The aim here is to be able to start a fire even in wet conditions. This can be achieved through waterproof matches, a lighter, or a pre-packaged fire-starting kit. 

Repair kit and tools – A repair kit containing duct tape, a knife (can range from a small knife to a hatchet), small scissors, needle and thread will be especially useful in case you get a rip in your tent, sleeping bag or backpack. This could be the thing that saves you from being soaked all night because your tent ripped and started letting water in!

Sun Protection 

The best way to prevent an uncomfortable sunburn is to protect yourself before it even happens! Sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses are invaluable tools and should be used even on days that do not seem obviously sunny. The risk increases as more elevation is gained, so always be prepared with sunscreen at a minimum.

Now that you know the bare minimum you need for a successful backpacking trip, you can build on this list and add other items that will enhance your experience and best suit your needs. As mentioned above, there are many variants to the things one can carry, and each of those options come with different weights and specifications. What you decide to bring with you will be dependent on how much you want to carry, and how far you plan to go, and as long as you have the essentials, you will be well prepared for the outdoors.

Why I Hike
 
Photo by Shreya Swaika, Pathloom
 Hike
To hike is to let yourself go, forget all your troubles, and just enjoy being in the outdoors. It is about both the journey and the destination. Today I am a passionate hiker and I spend every opportunity I get in the mountains. Whether it's day-hikes or backpacking trips, you can be sure to find me puttering along somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. But it was not always this way. Let me take you on a journey of how I developed an unquenchable thirst for hiking and adventuring in the outdoors. 
 As an impressionable young pre-teen, I started attending a boarding school that was nestled in the Nilgiri Mountains in Southern India. Every morning we would be woken up at the crack of dawn and made to go cross-country running. Back then, having to run on beautifully manicured trails surrounded by mountains and tea gardens just seemed to be more of a chore than a fun activity. I quickly realized that I liked the mountains and the views, but not so much the running! There is always something for everyone to enjoy in the outdoors, we just have to figure out what best suits us and our needs. For me, at the time it was hiking and horseback riding. I was fortunate that the school took us on camping trips every semester. I learned a lot about camping and self-reliance, and further developed my passion for long hikes and the outdoors in general. In high school, the Duke of Edinburgh program (an outdoor program based on kilometers hiked/biked/backpacked and extra-curricular achievements) was offered at our school, so I of course jumped on that opportunity. That was my first introduction to multi-day hiking and backpacking. Ankit, the founder of Pathloom, also went to the same high school and participated in this eye-opening program. Who would have thought that so many years later, our love for outdoors would lead to us working together!
 As life went on and I grew up and went to University, hiking and the outdoors took a backseat while I focused on education and my career. I was living in several different places, none particularly close to the mountains. Then a few years ago, as luck would have it, my career brought me close to the Rocky Mountains. I was fairly new to alpine hiking when I first moved close to the Rockies, but my curiosity and love for nature would not let me go too long without giving it a shot. I asked a friend to take me on one of her favorite hikes, not really knowing at all what to expect. So, dressed in my skinny jeans and sneakers, in 40-degree weather, with snow still on the ground, I embarked on my first real hiking adventure as an adult! Huffing and puffing my way up this very steep slope, I started to question my decision and the meaning of life itself. Luckily for me, shortly after this, we reached the top, and the view was breathtaking. Literally. I was out of breath! The bird’s-eye view of a stunning turquoise lake surrounded by snow-capped peaks instantly had me hooked. That is when I caught the hiking bug. I could think of nothing better than sitting with my legs dangling off a hill, having lunch and chatting with my friend, and all the while looking out at the most incredible view.

I had a demanding job at the time and was not left with a lot of time to plan extended trips in the mountains. Life gets in the way of our hobbies sometimes, but we can come up with creative ways to work around these issues. I decided to start out with shorter day hikes that were closer to the city so I could still get out and explore, which was better than not doing anything all at. 
 Since there wasn’t one website or app I could use to get information and scope out future hikes, I did some digging on different blogs and parks websites, and  found my next big hike!  It was a short drive and a short hike, but the trail was steep and an unrelenting uphill the whole way. I still did not have hiking shoes or any kind of actual outdoor gear because I simply could not afford it at the time. I was broke but unstoppable! Equipped with my runners and multiple sweatshirts, I decided to give it a try. A grinding two hours into the trail, my friends and I reached the first false summit. Across the way, we could see the valley open up, with a pointed mountain right opposite us. A green glacial lake sat at the base of the opposing mountain. It was majestic. We turned back onto our trail and saw the fun that was yet to come - a steep hill of loose rock and some minor scrambling at the very end. After a quick snack and water break, we journeyed on and eventually got to the top. At the end of this extremely difficult and strenuous trail, atop one of the highest peaks I had summited, I was elated. I forgot the soreness of my muscles and the panting of my breath. All I was feeling was this immeasurable ounce of peace and fulfillment. Standing 8,300 ft above sea-level, looking out at a horizon dotted with beautiful yet intimidating peaks gave me a kind of clarity I had never experienced before. I had managed to achieve a personal goal as well as benefit from the astounding views surrounding me. There are few experiences and moments that can compare. After multiple photos, videos, and some more snacks, we started our descent. Back at the parking lot by the trailhead, I was tired but could not have been happier.

The mental gains from a quick four hours in the outdoors helped me more than I could have imagined! This gave me the motivation to continue hiking, and today, many years later, I am healthier both mentally and physically, because of it. I have since been on numerous day hikes, backpacking trips both in Canada and abroad, and have introduced friends and colleagues to the wonders of the outdoors.

Now that you have read about my journey, it is time to embark upon one of your own! If you want to set yourself free, believe that you can achieve anything you want, and just be happy, give the outdoors a chance. Hiking is what I find most rewarding, but it could be something different for you. The options are endless.

A good starting point when considering a camping trip is knowing what type of camping will be best suited to you. It is very important to know what exactly you are getting into, so that you can be better prepared when you embark on your summer adventure! Even if you have been on camping trips in the past, you may discover through this article that there are several different ways to camp, and might find something new that piques your interest.

If you are new to camping and want to get a better understanding of why camping is awesome, check out our article on 'Why Camping Will Turn Your Summer Around.'

Types of Campsites: Developed, Designated and Dispersed

Types of Camping: Frontcountry and Backcountry

Types of Campsites:
 Developed: Has all the amenities one would need to be comfortable and almost feel at home! These include flushing toilets, showers, internet, charging outlets, picnic tables, tent pads, fire-pits, logs, among other amenities.

Designated: Has minimal amenities like maybe a pit toilet or rock fire ring and tent pad area.

Dispersed: Has no amenities and is focused on self-reliance in the wilderness.

Types of Camping:
 
Frontcountry Camping

This type of camping is the perfect blend between home comforts and outdoor recreation. 
One of the most common ways to frontcountry camp is to drive your vehicle to a campsite and then pitch your tent right next to it! It is affordable, easy to plan, and family-friendly. Frontcountry  campgrounds can be developed or designated sites and can either be booked in advance, or, more frequently, can be operated on a first-come first-serve basis. Frontcountry campgrounds have varying amenities, so looking out for which amenities most suit your needs is a good way to start. There is no limit (other than the space in your vehicle!) as to the amount of food, drinks, cooking utensils, etc. that you can bring. Depending on the size of your tent, a blow-up air mattress can be inflated on the spot, and you can carry comfortable blankets and pillows taken right from your bed at home. This way, you do not have to be apprehensive about sleeping on the floor or being uncomfortable.

Designated Campsites for Vans and RVs:

Another way to frontcountry camp is to have a Van or an RV. This significantly simplifies the camping experience for families because it is just like a movable home in the woods. It is also a good option for those that do not warm up to the idea of sleeping in a tent but still want to experience a night in the outdoors. An RV can be either a motorhome, or a trailer attached to your vehicle by a hitch. Either can be owned or rented depending on your preference.

Backcountry Camping

The “backcountry” is an area that is remote, and usually difficult to access. Depending on where you live and what your interests are, there are several different ways to arrive in the backcountry. It can be accessed by hiking, cycling, horseback riding or canoeing/kayaking in. Overlanding and driving your vehicle are also ways to access the backcountry. 

Designated and Developed campsites need to be booked in advance or can be obtained on a first-come first-serve basis. Some are fully developed with similar amenities to frontcountry camping, whereas others could have just the bare minimum. There can be more than one tent site available, so you could be sharing the campsite with other fellow campers. The number of tent sites is still much less than what one would find in a frontcountry campground, so do not be deterred by the partially communal nature of backcountry campgrounds. You will need to pack-in all your equipment, so carrying only what is essential is key. You can expect to filter your own water and protect your food from potential wildlife in the area if the campsite does not have food storage options. You will also need to pack out your own garbage and leave the area as if you were never there. 

If you are looking for something less luxurious than a designated or developed backcountry campsite, something with a hint of survival and adventure, then dispersed camping may be just what you need! It is the term used for camping anywhere outside of a developed or designated campground. It means going into the forest and pitching a tent in the wild.

 Dispersed camping is allowed in most National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas, and it is good practice to check which areas permit dispersed camping before planning your trip. In most cases, camping is not permitted near developed recreation areas such as designated campgrounds, trail heads and picnic areas, or near water sources and bodies. 

The options and variants to the types of dispersed camping trips are numerous as one can access the desired location by vehicle, foot, bicycle or any watercraft. If you are not interested in a long hike, and just want to spend a night in the wilderness whilst sleeping in the back of your car or a tent, dispersed camping is a great option. You can also use an ATV or dirt bike to go off-roading and set up camp in a remote location. Alternatively, you can plan this style of camping if you want to explore an area and spend all day hiking with the option of setting up camp at will. The same applies to a cycling trip, kayaking/canoeing or even horseback riding.

The major advantage of this style of camping is that it can be planned last-minute as no bookings need to be made ahead of time, except for places requiring permits. With the current Covid-19 situation, this is a great way to take a few days off and go on a trip solo or with company. There is no limit on the ways to plan a dispersed camping trip solely due to the independent and primitive nature of it. A dispersed camping trip does require a lot more planning as it does not come with any facilities or amenities. If an escape from people and crowds is what you crave, this is definitely for you.

Overlanding is another type of backcountry camping that involves driving any vehicle, ranging from motorbikes to trucks and jeeps, over numerous miles typically through off-highway and rugged terrain. Due to the motorized nature of it, overlanding trips can spread over international borders as well. The chosen mode of shelter is usually tenting on top of the vehicle.

To wrap up, there are many different combinations of camping trips one can plan. Having an idea of what the options are should help you decide which of these will best meet your requirements. The best part about planning a camping trip is the endless opportunity to try new ways to approach it, so whether this is your first time, or you’re a seasoned camper, there will always be a new and exciting perspective on camping.

Why Camping Will Turn Your Summer Around

 
Ever sat around a bonfire, roasting marshmallows, eating fresh food straight out of the BBQ, and just generally laughing and enjoying the moment?! Being disconnected from the world for a few hours, taking in the serenity of nature while breathing in that fresh, clean air. These are just a few of the things that should put camping on the top of your summer plans.


But what is camping, you ask. 

Camping has multiple definitions, but the simplest way to break it down is that it is a way for one to spend the night in the outdoors. Be it in a trailer or van, a tent, or even just in a sleeping bag right under the night sky, also known as “cowboy camping”.  Camping is a way for one to spend more time outdoors and have a choice as to how rugged or luxurious one wants to be while doing it. Camping is a way for one to get some peace and quiet, or a way to connect with friends and family. Basically, camping is what you decide to make of it.
                    For those of you that like to get out and travel, Covid-19 has probably thrown a wrench in your plans for the foreseeable future. For those of you that like to take a break and spend your days off locally, Covid-19 has not made that easy either - with travel restrictions and most restaurants and bars closed, not to mention a ban on large group gatherings, your original plans will have to be altered. Not cancelled. Just altered. Enter Camping. If you take advantage of the great outdoors, camping can turn your summer around and enable you to go on that solo or family trip after all.
  
But why will camping turn my summer around, you ask.

Here Is Why:
 
Driving out to the campsite, setting everything up and then just relaxing with some good company and good food will definitely help you escape your normal everyday routine and help you ease off that weekday stress.
In this current Covid-19 world that we live in, camping might actually be the one way you can reconnect with friends and family! Since the limit for the number of people gathering indoors is more restrictive than the outdoor limit, camping would be a great way to unite your loved ones and allow you to hang out with them outside for an extended period of time. While practicing social distancing measures of course, you will be able to enjoy a meal and catch up with everyone you have been missing. This does not mean we should forget about the necessary measures required to successfully organize and execute a group trip during this difficult time, and to help you navigate through that, check out our blog post about How to Recreate Safely During the Coronavirus Pandemic.
Camping can also be combined with other outdoor activities. If you enjoy doing outdoor activities such as hiking or cycling for example, camping can allow you to keep doing this all day, without having to worry about heading home before dark. Why not continue the day and spend the evening in the outdoors too!
If you are looking for a way to take a well-deserved break on a budget, camping is the solution you’ve been looking for. It might seem like a lot of equipment and gear upon first glance, but you can find everything you need for a trip for under $100.
The last reason that camping will turn your summer around is because it may be something new to you, and it may be something you would not have otherwise considered trying. Why not use this as an opportunity to explore your local area, and learn more about it?


If you like fresh air, good views and a good time, camping is definitely something you should try this summer. It will not disappoint!

5 Reasons To Start Hiking This Summer

 
A good friend has been saying lately “when was the last time you did something new for the first time?” For some of us, that might mean hitting up the trails and going on a hike! Trying something new can be daunting as well as exciting, and hiking definitely falls into that category. Whether you are thinking of taking a gentle stroll in the woods, or adding a new dimension to your daily workout, hiking holds the key to new adventures.


5 Reasons Why:
 1.  The first, most obvious one is the fact that hiking helps maintain physical fitness. If you are the kind of person that likes to stay active, why not take your workout to the next level and get some breathtaking views while you are at it? Striding through an endless valley, taking in the smell of fresh and pollution-free air, listening to that consistent sound of the wind ruffling through the trees… does that not sound like a fun workout? If you are the kind of person that enjoys the occasional walk or run, then why not elevate that experience by changing the scenery and trading in the pavement for a trail? With the current restrictions in place due to Covid-19, hiking is a great way to stay active and enjoy yourself too.


2.  Another not so obvious, but equally important benefit is the mental health gains from spending time on a trail. Think of hiking as a release starting right from the drive to the trailhead. You will find your mind switching gears and starting to focus more and more on the adventure ahead rather than the issues that have occupied your mind all week. The hike itself will act as nature’s own therapy where you are able to disconnect and just be in the moment. 


3.  Achieving personal goals is a great latent benefit to hiking. It is not a competitive sport and yet can be used for self-improvement. Since hiking is such a varied activity and can range from a leisurely walk on flat ground to a hard scramble on the side of a mountain, it can be used to set personal goals, which once achieved, do give a sense of fulfillment.


4.  For those of you that love to capture the moment on camera, hiking is a photographer’s paradise. How else will you find the stunning turquoise lakes enveloped in snow-capped peaks? Certainly not in the city! For photographers, artists, or just nature-lovers with a smartphone, hiking has so much to offer.


5.  The last and the best of all, is that hiking is mostly free! Most trails do not charge any fee at all to enter, and the few areas that require an entrance fee are worth the extra buck. Save some money this summer and hang out on the trails instead of the neighborhood bar. This may even be a safer option in terms of social distancing.


If you have reached the end and you are still with us, it means you too have that curiosity about hiking and the outdoors. Do not let it lie dormant. Unleash the inner adventurer, and head out to the trails on your next day off!

Is Backpacking For Me?

 Backpacking
Imagine yourself walking through a valley, the gentle murmur or a waterfall in the distance, vast open spaces filled with wildflowers and the occasional gofer, magnificent mountains engulfing the horizon. You feel at peace, you feel happy, you feel relieved and free of all those negative thoughts that were taking over your mind back in the city. You can finally breathe again. Now, imagine doing this with a 30-40 pound backpack! The scenery has not changed. That wonderful nature smell, that feeling of freedom has not evaded you. You are still waltzing through the valley, happy as a free bunny, but you are also carrying all your housing, sleeping, clothing and cooking equipment with you.


Now let us dive into what backpacking really is. If you are interested in exploring an area further, if you want to go deeper into the valley and maybe even summit a few of the mountains without having to worry about time or backtracking home the same day, backpacking is what you are looking for.


If you are following along, your next question is probably going to be: why make the extra effort and carry that weight all day long? The reasons are endless, the opportunities and variations are too.
Backpacking allows you to travel off the beaten path, making it possible for you to enjoy the peace and seclusion that come with the extra effort. It allows you to escape the more popular front-country and easy-access campsites - something that’s becoming increasingly important in today’s Covid-19 social distancing landscape. What better way to social distance than to venture into the backcountry and enjoy hundreds of acres of open space solo or with your hiking buddies!
People of all skill-levels can do this - one can start with an easier trip with less hiking time and elevation gain and go for a serviced backcountry campground. Some campgrounds often come equipped with cushy tent pads, picnic tables, fire rings, food lockers, potable water and outhouses. So, if you do not have much experience in the backcountry, this would be a great and safe place to start! However, with the pandemic, many of the serviced backcountry campgrounds remain closed and it is important to be careful when touching any commonly used surfaces like picnic tables, food lockers and outhouses.
Hiking for more than one day and stopping at various backcountry sites along the route will open up opportunities to travel through different landscapes, and if planned ahead, can be made into a loop or a thru-hike covering dozens of miles.


Okay, we have covered what backpacking is all about and why it is awesome, but is it really for me?

Take a quick second to go through this very brief list of questions:
Do I enjoy sleeping in the outdoors in a tent and a sleeping bag?
How do I feel about carrying a pack for a few hours a day?
Do I mind dealing with mosquitoes and bugs? 
Based on my knowledge/research of wildlife in the area I want to explore, how safe do I feel over-nighting there?
How does being deep in a valley or forest, far away from cell reception and the internet make me feel? Is it anxiety-inducing or calming?
If your answers to these questions made you feel even slightly comfortable and excited about the idea of hiking for a few hours and camping overnight, maybe backpacking is for you! 


It can seem intimidating at first, but backpacking can be catered to suit your needs if you think it is something worth trying. You do not need to be extremely fit or strong to have a successful backpacking trip - you just need an open mind and a sense of adventure. 

Now that you know what backpacking is, what are you waiting for, give it a shot!

How to Recreate Safely During the Coronavirus Pandemic


Disclaimer: The information presented here is accurate to the best of the author’s knowledge on the date of publication. Given the quickly evolving pandemic situation, Coronavirus regulations can and will change. Please consult applicable sources for the most up-to-date guidance on acceptable practices. 

 As we make our way into the second half of spring, temperatures are rising and we are all itching to get outside. However, the global Coronavirus pandemic continues to loom large, impact lives and complicate matters. There are many questions to answer that we previously never had to consider. Where can we recreate? What activities are allowed? What are the best ways to protect ourselves and those around us? 

During this pandemic, outdoor recreation remains as one of the few practical ways to get outside to maintain personal health, physical fitness and overall well-being. However, it is extremely important to maintain caution and adhere to social distancing standards while recreating outdoors, and following the frequently changing closures and restrictions. Whether it is going for a walk, run or something more, it is imperative to put the health and safety of yourself and others at the forefront through these challenging times.

Recreate responsibly by following all local, county, state and federal restrictions and closures; practicing social distancing at all times; and staying close to home for your recreation needs. Most National Parks remain closed, whereas Local and County Parks, State Parks, National Forests and BLM areas have varying closures and restrictions. Most developed facilities also remain closed to maintain social distancing standards. Through this article, you will learn how to look-up and follow the regulations that pertain to your area, and how to keep yourself safe. As you will see, it is not as complicated as it first might sound.


Destinations
 It is best not to travel for your recreation needs during the Coronavirus pandemic; stay close to home. Getting to your outdoor destination is more complicated now than it was just a few months ago. That said, it is still relatively straightforward to figure out where you can go while abiding by local and federal laws, and practicing social distancing. Here are 3 simple things you need to consider before traveling.
Is my recreation destination open?
What are the travel restrictions for where I live?
What are the travel restrictions for where I’m going?
Many National and State Parks that shut their doors at the start of the pandemic are now beginning to consider reopening in a safe manner. That’s great news for us as it means we can get out to the places we love just as summer is starting. Additionally, most National Forests and BLM areas have varying closures and restrictions, but many of the trails and backcountry destinations remain open. It is mainly the developed and frontcountry facilities that remain closed, which include restrooms, campgrounds, visitors centers, ranger stations, among other facilities.

To make the best of your trip, planning is key (when is it not?). Verify that the place you plan to visit is open before you head out by checking their website and getting in contact with appropriate authorities. Most State Parks, National Parks, National Forests and BLM areas have a webpage that will list useful information such as open status and which amenities are available. It is best to sort that out before you go, just as you probably would when traveling under normal circumstances. Also, it is worthwhile consulting the John Hopkins Coronavirus online tracker to ensure your destination is not a hot-zone. 

Figuring out your area’s travel restrictions might seem daunting at first, but it only takes a few minutes to do so. State and local governments have been publicizing new travel restrictions that have gone into effect. For example, if you Google search “Colorado travel,” one of the first results is a list of travel guidance from Colorado’s official tourism site. Perform a search like this for your respective state, county, and city of residence. Many cities and counties are simply echoing their state’s orders, though some may have stricter restrictions. If there are discrepancies in the guidance given by each, you are legally obligated to follow the strictest restrictions among them. For example, Colorado is currently issuing a 10-mile limit on recreational travel. However, Gunnison County, CO has issued a ban on all non-county resident visitors until May 27, 2020. Since the restrictions in Gunnison County are stricter than the state, you cannot legally travel to Gunnison County as a non-county resident, even if you live within 10 miles of the county.


Activities
 Thankfully, many of the day-use activities that were available to us before the Coronavirus pandemic remain available to us today. For instance, hiking, cycling and boating are largely allowed on open federal and state lands. However, developed campgrounds, bathrooms and picnic areas remain mostly closed, even in areas where trails remain open. Many rock climbing areas are also closed due to climbers inherently needing to touch the same rock surfaces. However, dispersed camping is still permitted in many of the National Forests and BLM areas. If going dispersed camping, be sure to pack-in and pack-out all trash, and follow fire safety precautions, leave no trace principles and any other restrictions that may be applicable. Contact the appropriate authorities when planning your trip to ensure the places and activities are open, and to learn about any active restrictions. Additionally, when considering types of activities to indulge in through this pandemic, it is important to maintain social distancing standards, and hence avoiding any group gatherings. 

A couple of notable closures include those of the U.S.’s two most popular long-distance hiking trails. The Appalachian Trail (AT) and Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) have closed at the request of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and Pacific Crest Trail Association, which oversee the two trails. The PCT shutdown is scheduled to last until June 1, 2020, though the AT has no specified opening date. Both dates are subject to change, so visit pcta.org and appalachiantrail.org for the most up-to-date information available.  

Even though most day-use activities and a few dispersed camping areas are still open, it pays to take some extra precautions when being active. Furthermore, due to limited resources being available through this pandemic, it is important to be even more vigilant when taking safety and responsible recreation into consideration. Many wilderness first responders are not operating on normal schedules and won’t be available to help as they normally would. If you hike, consider not venturing quite so far into the backcountry to reduce the risk of an injury getting you in a bad situation. Likewise, avoid taking risks on new activities. It may not be the best time to try backpacking if you’ve never gone before. If you get stuck or your car breaks down in a hard-to-reach place, the chances of someone getting out to you quickly becomes slim, hence practice precaution when planning.


Staying Safe &amp; Best Practices
 Many of the things we can do to keep ourselves safe involve only small changes to our normal routines. In this section we discuss tips for limiting your exposure to viral transmission and to those around you.


Packing

When packing for your trip, take into consideration everything you might need and some more. Make sure your vehicle has no major issues that could cause a breakdown. Bring extra clothes, food and water. If you have a GPS/satellite communication device, this would be a great time to carry that with you at all times when recreating outdoors. If considering dispersed camping, be sure to be self-contained and pack-in and pack-out all your trash. If having a campfire, practice extreme precaution with fire safety and have necessary permits as we are entering the fire season in many parts of the country.


Getting to Your Destination

Protecting yourself and your family while getting to your destination can be achieved with just a few changes to your regular itinerary. Fill up with gas and purchase food at your regular gas station and grocery store near your home. Doing so will limit your exposure to people and facilities in other regions. For the same reason, go directly to your destination without making unnecessary stops along the way. When filling up gas, getting a drive-thru or stopping at a grocery store, wear masks and gloves to limit viral transmission. It is recommended that you do not travel for your recreation needs and stay close to home.

Since many backcountry facilities and National Forest trails require taking some dirt road, be aware of the current road conditions and if your vehicle is safe to take on such roads. It would be best to consult with the respective authorities to obtain the most up-to-date information on current road conditions and closures.


Avoid Crowded Areas

Before you even pull into the trailhead parking lot, judge how busy the area is. If cars are lining the grassy shoulder ¼ mile in either direction, that area is probably too crowded to maintain any semblance of social distancing. Move on to another area. Sometimes impromptu changes in plans make for the most memorable days out. 

If parking is available, pull into a spot non-adjacent to other people doing things around their cars. Since viral transmission occurs primarily person-to-person, if you are not near anyone, risk of contraction is low. Gather your things for your outdoor excursion of choice and get going. If stretching is a part of your pre-activity ritual, consider doing it somewhere nearby where others won’t have to walk right next to you as they go to and from their vehicles. Avoid touching trailhead signs, sign-in sheets and any other surfaces that might risk contamination. When around others, it is essential to wear your face mask and to maintain social distancing to limit the chances of viral transmission.


On Trail

Face coverings remain recommended for use while out in public. To improve your trail experience, consider using a buff as an alternative to a bandanna. Buffs, which are stretchy cloth tubes, can be easier to breathe through and are simpler to adjust. 

When you come up to another trail user heading in the opposite direction, move to the far side of the trail to give each other room to pass. Many trails are narrow that do not allow much room for passing. In these situations, try and provide as much space as reasonably possible. The local geography and common sense will dictate if and how far you can step off trail, but follow trail regulations to always keep on the trail. If you see someone approaching and spot a good place to step aside, consider taking advantage of that space and waiting until they make their way by you.
 Enjoy the Outdoors!
 Hopefully the tips presented here will give you some food for thought regarding how to recreate responsibly and safely in the time of the global Coronavirus pandemic. During these challenging times, getting outdoors is one of the greatest things we can do for our physical and mental health and well-being. If we all take a couple of extra steps before getting outside, there is no reason we cannot all enjoy the outdoors safely and responsibly.

Why I Love Vacationing Outdoors!

“The mountains are calling and I must go.”
– John Muir

 Vacationing in the outdoors has been life-changing for me. Now, it’s pretty much a part of my lifestyle and the way I travel. As a matter of fact, it’s the way I prefer vacationing – involving some elements of spending time outside in nature – whether it’s hiking, sightseeing, camping, off-roading, backpacking or simply just taking a stroll through the woods. Being immersed in the elements takes me out of the normal day-to-day life and allows me the opportunity to just enjoy and live the moment, and appreciate the very simple things in life. The more I immerse myself into the outdoors, the more I begin to cherish the songs of the birds, the soothing rhythm of the creeks and the glistening stars that overtake the night skies.
 I love vacationing outdoors and it’s pretty much the only way I travel now. 


Childhood Vacations
 My love for nature is deeply rooted through my childhood. For as long as I could remember, trips out in nature gleefully overtook our family vacations in India. We’ve explored many remote regions of the Himalayas including Nepal and Bhutan, and even the deserts of Rajasthan, forests of Madhya Pradesh and backwaters of Kerala, just to list a few. These adventures would inevitably shape my childhood, leading me to the person that I am today.
 Though mostly car-based trips, we spent a lot of time outside in the elements traveling through varying terrains and environments, high-altitude being my favorite. There’s just something about elevation and how it takes the breath out of you in just a few steps. Most of these vacations involved sightseeing, jeep safaris, picnicking and some hiking to get to hill-perched temples and monasteries. However, spending time with my family in truly unique accommodations that blow-you-away are what made these experiences even more memorable. They didn’t have to be luxurious or glamorous like a hotel room, nature was glamorous enough. Whether it was an isolated cottage in the hills, or a bird-watching retreat deep in the forest or a cozy home-stay in a village, I would always crave an additional night when it came time to leave (and I still do!). 
 Through the years, I had also taken many exciting road trips all over the States with my mother including the majestic Grand Canyon, mystical Ruby Falls &amp; the Smokies and breathtaking Niagara Falls. We even visited some neighboring destinations including Stanley Park and the awe-inspiring Whistler region in Canada, and a memorable cruise to the pristine blue waters of the Bahamas (I had won a Bingo game with a prize of about $1,000, which I was absolutely ecstatic about at the time). However, it was on these road trips where I had my first visit to the picturesque Yosemite Valley and Glacier Point in California, a place I would eventually return to many times.

Asides from my family vacations, I had participated in a few summer camps through elementary and middle schools in the U.S., which also hold some of my most memorable experiences through my childhood. I remember hiking and spending a few days in the Santa Cruz mountains in California exploring and learning about the Redwoods’ ecosystem. There was nothing like the comradery of more than 50 kids singing songs around a large campfire as the sky darkened. This was something new to me, and till this day, those moments overshadow some of my most influential learning experiences growing up. However, it wasn’t until a high school trekking trip, where my indulgence for the real outdoors took the spotlight and changed the course of my life.

Many Chocolate Bars Later...
 I was in my second year of high school when the opportunity arose to participate in a multi-week-long trekking trip to Pindari Glacier in the Kumaon region of the Himalayas in Uttar Pradesh, India. With an elevation of about 12,000 ft, Pindari Glacier lies besides the mighty Nanda Devi range, with the Nanda Devi peak rising to an impressive 25,643 ft, making it India's 2nd highest peak and the world’s 23rd highest peak. This was going to be my first real trekking/backpacking experience; although each night we would end up with a mattress and hot food prepared fresh by the local residents, which felt like a blessing after long and enduring days of trekking and eating mostly chocolate bars for snacks. 

We were a group of about 15 people consisting mostly of us high school students, a few teachers and a local guide. I remember the night before starting the trek, there was much anticipation and excitement among the group as we had been preparing months in advance for what was to come. Our packs were all packed and ready to go with a lot of chocolate bars for energy – this was very amusing to me at the time, but by the end of the trip, I could not eat another chocolate bar. What we had on our backs were all the personal belongings that we would have access to for the next couple of weeks – this was the lightest I’d packed by this point for any trip; yet our packs seemed quite heavy anyways. 
 The physical toll of the path really began to kick in within the first few days of the journey with me getting a calf-muscle cramp by the end of the very first day. However, as the days progressed, the trekking became more natural and second nature. Through the trek, we encountered numerous unforgettable sights like lush and humid forests, ice-cold rivers, glistening waterfalls, panoramic mountain views, pristine glaciers and breathtaking high-altitude passes, which literally took the breath out of you during the ascents. There was a sense of gratefulness to be alive and in getting to explore these remote regions in such an immersive way.
 Along the trek, we met many hospitable locals and their furry companions at their farmlands and idyllic homes. They welcomed us with soothing refreshments and hearty meals (mostly vegetarian). There was an occasion where I tried goat meat for the first time; it didn’t sit quite right with my mouth – I think it was the very chewy texture. By the end of the trip, we were all exhausted, but had just gone through a life-defining moment.
 The trek had an especially profound effect on me. More specifically, maturing my life philosophy and providing me a better balance between convenience and personal growth. This was one of the most challenging and adventurous things that I’d done in my life up to this point, and the experience was truly eye-opening into the wonders of the outdoors and long-duration treks. The magic of venturing into the outdoors and spending days on end just putting one foot in front of the other; it really becomes a zen-like state where you get a chance to critically reflect on life, and build a desire to simply wander and explore. A chance most of us don’t get in the hustle and bustle of city life.
 Up to this point, I valued convenience and comfort in a very high regard and had based a lot of my decision-making in life on such a premise. Moreover, trying to stay away from things that might seem difficult, challenging or uncomfortable. Ultimately, it’s what we are wired to do as humans and is a widely accepted philosophy regarding making life easier – the premise behind many machines and technologies. This is important and it enables us to get away from redundant tasks while redirecting our efforts to more critically and creatively engaging ways. However, we can often let this overpower us and prevent us from trying out or indulging in things which might seem inconvenient, uncomfortable or overwhelming – like being outdoors. I would argue that there are two ways to be uncomfortable, one that pushes towards physical discomfort, but the other that simply results from unfamiliarity – like something new that we might not be used or exposed to as being normal. It is the unfamiliarity-related discomfort which I learned a lot about through this trip and grew from personally; although I appreciated and learned from some of the physical discomfort in the trip as well. 
 Through my remaining years in high school, I participated in several other smaller school-organized trips where we took hikes through the forests in Southern India. In one of these trips, I experienced my first night in a tent, which was quite memorable in its own regard, although the tents were already set up for us. However, it wasn’t until my first year at university where I set up my first tent on a road trip, finally!


A Trip to the Keys, A Key to More Road Trips
 My first camping night in the U.S. was during a road trip with friends to the Everglades and Key West in Florida. It was the beginning of summer, and we had just finished our second year in University. We had packed up the car and headed out for an adventure to the southernmost point of the continental U.S. We stayed at a RV park for two nights and this was the first time I had pitched a tent; it felt great! From what I remember, the set up was a smooth process without much hassle. It was great to come back to our tent to rest after eventful days exploring the Keys.
 After the Everglades and Key West in Florida, a friend and I were inspired to embark on another road trip that same summer across the country from Florida to California. The adventure spanned across the southern portion of the U.S., all the way to LA and the Bay Area. Although we crashed for the multiple nights at a few friends’ places along the way and didn’t camp through this trip, this road trip opened me up to long-distance road trips as it was my first self-driven long-distance road trip. While in California, I explored a few Bay Area hikes, taking several road trips with a couple of friends across Southern and Northern California and portions of Southern Oregon, which included a few nights of spectacular tent camping along the coast. 
 It wasn’t until a couple of years later, once I had finished my undergrad, that I took another major camping trip. A trip to Utah and then Colorado; this is where things really picked up in a new gear, solo trips.


A New Gear, Solo Trips
 The summer I graduated from my undergrad, a friend and I decided to take a road trip through Utah and Colorado. This felt like my first ‘real’ camping experience as this was my first multi-day camping road trip through National Parks and Forests, requiring more preparation, planning and gear than any other trip I had taken before. Also, I had to do the primary planning for this trip as compared to relying on my friends’ expertise from previous outdoor trips.
 On the first day, we entered Zion National Park in Utah around sunrise. This being my first time in Utah, it left an awe within me. The memory I have of the sights are very vivid as I had never seen such a dramatic and unique landscape before. The multitude of colors, mind-bending rock formations, vast openness, just magnificent. We’d spent the first night at the Lava Point Campground in the park after exploring a few sights and hikes. The drive to the campground was along a long, empty and winding gravel road, eventually climbing to around 8,000 ft. The views were incredible and drastic with mountains, canyons and lava beds. Zion holds a special place in my heart. The next day, as we geared up for driving towards Moab, my friend got a phone call resulting in her having to return home early. So, we did. However, this is where an entirely new chapter began.
 Once back from the abruptly shortened trip, my friend was extremely nice to encourage me to continue the trip by myself giving me the confidence to go on my own. Up to this point in my life, I had never taken a solo vacation, let alone a solo multi-day camping trip. Within a week, after much pondering and researching, I was convinced and ready to embark on the trip. So, I did. By the end of that week, I was well on my way with a revised itinerary and some additional gear. I didn’t know the profound impact this trip was going to have on me and how it would re-shape my thinking, and hence, my life.
 I embarked on my 2-week solo camping road trip with my first stop being in the San Juan National Forest. For my first night, I’d camped at a dispersed campsite by the river in the National Forest, right off a state highway. Never had I spent so much time by myself, and this was only my first night! Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed myself, keeping myself preoccupied with reading, cooking and relaxing by the campfire. The picturesque scenery and gently flowing river certainly helped as well. It seemed the evening would come and go. I started the next morning with a refreshing wash on my face from the river's numbing water, and cooked up a warm breakfast as I waited for the canyon-blocked sunlight to reach me to let my tent dry up.
 I planned a loop through Colorado, driving no more than 6 hours each day after the initial drive from Arizona. My loop consisted of Alta Lakes in San Juan National Forest, Telluride, Uncompahgre National Forest, Gunnison National Forest, Pike’s Peak, Golden, Denver, Independence Pass, Grand Junction, Aspen and the majestic Maroon Bells. The lavish mountain towns of Telluride and Aspen were amazing to explore with its ski-lift gondolas providing for spectacular scenery. Camping next to picturesque high-alpine lakes, on the banks of cold flowing rivers or on mountain sides overlooking lush valleys; all these experiences made the trip something which is etched through my memories. What topped it all off was all the amazing people I met and shared laughs with throughout my journey. It's the irony leading so many of my solo trips. It is when I am camping or am on the trail alone that I cross paths with some of the most remarkable, perfect strangers. There is a deeply rooted connection with them of that shared experience and being immersed in the outdoors, leading to more adventures yet to come.
 At the end, I remember taking a serene drive back across Eastern Utah where the sky and road seemed to blend by the horizon. During sunset, the sky became disorientating with stunning views and contrasting colors. It was day to the right of me and evening to the left. The contrast was simply captivating. 
 Before I knew it, the trip was already over, and I was back at my apartment unloading gear, yearning to get back out on another trip. This trip had really captured my imagination for the outdoors, and I knew there were a lot more solo and camping trips to come. It essentially shaped a new framework for traveling and vacationing for me.


A New Framework for Vacationing
 A few years down the line, with many more solo camping and hiking trips later, I often reflect on my first solo camping trip through Colorado and draw inspiration from it. That trip provided me with a new framework for not only vacationing, but how I approach life in general. I try to get outdoors as often as possible and have integrated it into my lifestyle. Even on my birthdays over the past few years, I’ve thrown camping-based get-togethers at group sites in National Forests; it made for epic birthdays.
 Since my trip to Colorado, I’ve camped, hiked and road tripped across many regions in the U.S., including the Badlands, Grand Tetons, Shoshone Falls, Adirondack Mountains; and across the states of Nebraska, Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, and most notably, Oregon and California. Also, I’ve taken several small backpacking trips through the Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and various regions in California, including the Lost Coast Trail in Northern California. Even my family vacations in India nowadays include elements of hiking and the outdoors, and not too long ago, I even took my first ever solo vacation through the Himalayas in India.
 All of these experiences have helped shape who I am today and what I enjoy, which is spending time in nature and the great outdoors. I am grateful for the opportunities that I’ve had to explore and travel, and I thank my friends and family in supporting me in my adventures. More importantly, these experiences have brought me closer to myself, becoming more reflective in my approach to life, which I absolutely cherish. Spending time in nature and the outdoors are an integral part of my life, and vacationing outdoors is my way of doing it. I am in such love with the outdoors that even for a recent conference in Pasadena, California, I decided to make the most of it by staying in a modified trailer accommodation (Airbnb) instead of a hotel room, and I absolutely loved it. I couldn’t believe I was in a city; the open space and views were simply magnificent! 

My own experiences and that of others plays a crucial role in the inspiration behind Pathloom, and the need for a better way to discover unique destinations and plan for outdoors vacations.


Every outdoors person has their own unique connection to the outdoors and nature, what’s yours?
